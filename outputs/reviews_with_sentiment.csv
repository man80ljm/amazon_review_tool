1,B0BRXPG99Q,Screen doesn’t work and won’t calibrate..Screen is too dark and won’t calibrate so we can’t even use the pencil portion of the toy and of course you don’t know that until you open the toy all the way up. Do not recommend.,1,2026-01-1,negative

18,B0BRXPG99Q,"you can't hear the volume as you should,.I purchased this for my granddaughter and the volume is very hard to hear. I got this for my daughter when she was a child and love all the  Leaf Frog products and couldn't wait to get her this as well. I got it and I'm very disappointed with the product, volume on high you still could not hear it to play with it and enjoy it. I would really appreciate it if someone could contact me.DisappointmentLisa",1,2023-12-29,negative

22,B0BRXPG99Q,"Broken screen.Half the screen flickers like it’s been damaged. No outter package was shipped with the product, just the box itself, so I don’t know if that caused initial damage to the screen. It seems like a screen defect is common with this product though.",2,2025-05-16,negative
23,B0BRXPG99Q,Eh.Doesn’t let you program name easily,2,2025-04-29,negative
24,B0BRXPG99Q,"This COULD be great…..But it only allows you to do an activity three times before forcing you to select another activity again. So, if your child is on the letter writing activity, they can write three letters and that’s it and then it tells them to select another activity. You can select the same activity again, but you can’t just continue on without restating the activity. Why in the world would it do this? It prevents kids from being able to focus for more than 1-2 minutes at a time. My child immediately hated this after it made her pick an activity when she was focused and happily writing letters. Now she doesn’t use it.",2,2025-02-14,negative
25,B0BRXPG99Q,"Product Letters and black spots.We received the leapfrog device yesterday and I'm not understanding what's going on with the letters. It appears there are black spots or the paint is chipping. The device itself is working fine, however when the letters disappear it will be no use for learning. I've ordered 3 of these for my grandchildren ages 4 to 6, and to are artistic. We need the letters to stay visible. Thinking of cancelling pending shipping orders of the other 2 devices.",2,2024-11-19,negative
26,B0BRXPG99Q,"Touch screen does not work.Very cute learning toy. However the touch screen does not work, this ruined the appeal completely.",2,2024-11-17,negative
27,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great concept.I think it’s an effective way of learning, but I would feel better about it if the buttons on the lower right actually worked so my 4year old can do the activities.",2,2023-08-18,negative

32,B0BRXPG99Q,Leapfrog review.I love that my child is learning to write his letters and numbers. He loves to learn new words. But I've only had it for 4 months and the screen is significantly scratched up and I know he is only using the pencil...,3,2025-04-30,negative
33,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great! Light brightness on screen.Love this tablet for my 4 year old learning. The brightness is my only complaint. He says it's very hard to read the screen. The learning and practice is great! The size is perfect for road trips and he doesn't seem to beg for his iPad as often, always a win!",3,2025-04-30,positive
34,B0BRXPG99Q,"Weak graphics but fulfills purpose.Great product, a bit behind on the graphics for 2025 but it still served the purpose.  If you own a tablet, there are many apps that would be much cheaper and more graphic satisfying.3 stars for the above reasons",3,2025-04-29,positive
35,B0BRXPG99Q,Fun but not Durable.My 4 year old received this for Christmas. I love the way it works and how it teacher. But it’s a kids toy which means it gets dropped more than a normal item. We’ve only had it 3 weeks & part of the screen already is not working. So my son is getting frustrated he can’t use the toy properly :(,3,2025-01-9,negative
36,B0BRXPG99Q,"Empaque deteriorado.Le doy 3 estrellas porque el empaque vino en muy malas condiciones y dicho sea de paso lo compré para un regalo.Aún dañada la caja, el articulonse encuentra en muy buen estado.

38,B0BRXPG99Q,"The pen is thick.The pen is too thick.  I didn't consider  the small hand that would be using it, when I purchased it. not something he picks when it's time to work on alphabet.  He's 3yrs old.",3,2024-05-19,negative
39,B0BRXPG99Q,"Return window Jan 31, my luck.The media could not be loaded.Like it but weird discoloration started right before return window closed. Still works for now. But keeps acting like it needs batteries but their new. Maybe I got a bad one. But the kid likes it. Get it on sale and hopefully it last",3,2024-02-4,positive
40,B0BRXPG99Q,Slightly different.I got the green one of these from target and needed to get another one for my daughter so I found this pink one.It works great and the color is cute.Only problems are that the string is just a little shorter than the green target version. And the main problem is that the pencil is hard to get in and out of the holder (unlike the green one). So an adult has to help. So that’s annoying.The toy itself is great though. My kids love them and are good at writing their names and numbers and letters.,3,2024-01-26,positive
41,B0BRXPG99Q,Much smaller in person.Very small,3,2024-01-20,negative
42,B0BRXPG99Q,Can’t Add Every Name.The toy is fun and educational but one major complaint for us. My kiddos name contains three letters in succession that also spell a “bad word.” The tablet won’t allow you to type those letters even in the context of another word. This results in the name function not working because we aren’t able to enter the spelling of his name due to those three letters being in the middle of the name. I understand having a “filter” option to not enter certain words but not letting you type anything that even contains those letters is frustrating.,3,2023-12-26,negative
43,B0BRXPG99Q,まぁまぁ.うちの5歳と3歳がたまに遊びます。持ち運びには良いと思います。,3,2024-12-6,negative

45,B0BRXPG99Q,Great toy for a five year old..My five year old LOVED THIS.The only issue is that the sound got significantly lower after a few days of playing with it even after changing the batteries.  I don’t mind the lower sound but found it strange this would happen.,4,2026-01-2,negative

47,B0BRXPG99Q,Positive reinforcement provided encouraging the user to keep going..I love that you can personalize it for more than one child.  You can add more than one name to practice name writing.  We also love the positive feedback at certain points it provides and the reinforcement.  Overall great purchase the children love it .,4,2025-12-28,positive
48,B0BRXPG99Q,Great for kids.Perfect early learning tool,4,2025-12-19,positive
49,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great learnings tool with room for a couple of improvements.We’ve really enjoyed using the LeapFrog Mr. Pencil’s Scribble, Write and Read! I love that the pencil is connected in the middle, making it easy for both right and left-handed kids to use, super thoughtful design. The two volume levels are great for different settings, and being able to program up to three names is a fantastic feature. It’s helped my preschooler start learning how to spell and write his full name, which is a huge win.That said, I do wish there were more preprogrammed words for kids to practice spelling and pronunciation, it would really extend the product’s learning value. Also, the screen is tough to see in outdoor lighting, even on an overcast day under a shelter. A toggleable backlight would be a great addition.Overall, it’s a great educational toy with a lot of potential, just a couple tweaks away from perfect.",4,2025-08-14,positive
50,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great for fun. Don’t bank on it for teaching kids how to write properly.My toddler loves it. Saved us a lot of frustration on long drives. It also helped her get used to the letter shapes. She has hours of fun writing on it.It won’t teach them pencil grip and control though. I wouldn’t suggest this if you want to buy it for teaching kids how to write. This is like any other learning tablet, they can learn their letters and have fun with some drawing, but this should not be the primary tool teaching them how to write.",4,2025-06-26,negative
51,B0BRXPG99Q,Great toy / learning tool.Kept my 5 yo occupied for a 2.5 hour car ride but is so annoying to hear as a parent in the drivers seat - especially when you realize you’re singing the songs to yourself at work the next week,4,2025-06-23,negative

61,B0BRXPG99Q,"School Prep Must.My 5 yo grandson had no interest in ""learning"" over the summer.  Concerned he might have a learning disability, I ordered this for him.  Mr. Pencil quickly reinforced what he learned in Pre-school.  He still grabs it after school to practice.  Not every day, but often enough that it wasn't a waste of money.",4,2024-08-24,negative

64,B0BRXPG99Q,Practice.This is a nice tablet my 4 year old likes it but it has too many options and is distracting it would be nice if it only focused on letter and name writing.,4,2024-04-6,negative
65,B0BRXPG99Q,"Engaging, probably over-stimulatung.I got this when my kid started getting really interested in spelling. So far it's been great keeping him engaged with the letter writing feature. So overall positive. Be aware it's considerably on the flashing lights, constant sounds/talking, over-stimulatung side of things, which I wish would get toned down.",4,2024-02-29,positive

69,B0BRXPG99Q,"Educational but not captivating.As a parent, I think this is a great toy. It is simple, educational and portable. However, it did not capture my child’s interest all that much. I’ll continue to give it a chance",4,2023-12-26,positive

72,B0BRXPG99Q,"Disappointed.The media could not be loaded.I’ve bought two for my girls and unfortunately this is how the buttons look after ONE DAY of using them a few minutes. For what I can see the white part inside this buttons crack every time you push them so I expect the letters and numbers to be gone by a month or less, is the cheapest quality for a such a good toy. I wanted to contact de seller but I couldn’t find any option, if the seller wants to contact me and work it out I would be willing to change my mind otherwise I’m definitely returning it.Update: I did return both and received a replacement with a better quality but still not the best quality.

119,B0BRXPG99Q,So many advantages!!.If your baby is in the stage of being intrigued with movement and building/focusing this is perfect to introduce writing skills. Especially if you have a newborn and you want to avoid small pieces of other toys being on the floor. This is easy to pick up and put away and replaces old toys you get tired of stepping on or seeing on the floor all while advancing your toddler. Love leapfrog 👌,5,2025-11-17,positive

141,B0BRXPG99Q,"Amazing.This is great! Works amazing, tells them if the letters are upper or lowercase. It has 3 name place so they can learn first, middle and last name.

142,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great for kiddos to begin learning.I bought this for my 3-year-old daughter, and she loves it. It was well worth the money alone for her educational learning. The product takes 2 double-A batteries, which last a long time. The buttons are easily pressed, and the pencil does its job when using this feature.  There is no adjustable brightness on this product; however, I do not see why it would be needed. The screen is easily read and the sound is adjustable to hear at the perfect level.",5,2025-08-21,positive

They love the interactive games, and it’s educational and fun, which is a win-win for me. It’s also been a total lifesaver during long car rides and at restaurants — it keeps them entertained and learning at the same time. Highly recommend for any parent looking for a fun way to build early literacy skills!",5,2025-07-31,positive

The unit has two volumes on it which is nice and the Mr pencil is attached to the unit so there is no losing it. Both my daughters have gotten usage out of it even the younger one who is only two and a half. Would recommend to anyone who's looking to have an item that teaches and doesn't have a super fancy screen. It has numerous things to do on board and it's pretty comprehensive.,5,2025-07-9,positive

173,B0BRXPG99Q,Great for learning..This has been helping us keep our very easily distracted 4 year old interested in learning his letters and learning to write them as well.

We opened it and little one was excited to play with it but the top left corner of screen doesn’t work and the screen doesn’t rotate and lock when I laptop mode, making that function useless. Of course, it’s past the return date but it wasn’t opened until Christmas. The leapfrog company said there’s a 90 day warranty but it doesn’t apply because of purchase date.

229,B06XL1B7QN,"Impossible to see, completely useless although nice concept.The screen is completely unviewable, first the screen is very reflective which makes it catch light and have high glare, second the contrast of the screen (black LCD over blue-lit background) is so poor that you cannot see anything anyways beyond some vague shapes, third the viewing angle is non-existent - if you move 1 degree up/left/down/right it also completely removes visibility.  Beyond this, the actual concept is nice with 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, children email writing, and songs, but there's not much here that you wouldn't find in almost any other children's toy (maybe like 30-40 permutations of songs/activities/etc) but since you can't see anything anyways, it's much more frustrating for the child than fun and you'll get alot of anger/crying with it.

What I notice was the hook where you would lift up the laptop up. I believe that pops off and that’s the problem, I could be wrong all I know it’s very annoying problem.

318,B06XL1B7QN,PARENTS BE AWARE OF MUSIC MODE.I have to write this review on my laptop however I am warning all parents of the music mode touch screen. As parents know children soak things up as a sponge soaks up water. They have big imaginations and tend to emulate what they see. I am big on a child remaining as a child and not being a raunchy adult. There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion. Yes its a great tool to help them learn but be vigilant because if not monitored could easily introduce vulgar and inapropriate movements in your child. Not surprising considering Netflix and cuties and now people trying to force children to make adult decisions at school..... Ima leave it there...,2,2022-11-7,negative

The problem is, she had absolutely no interest in it. To be fair, she uses a Kindle Fire and has an old iPhone, which are obviously more advanced than this product. However, I thought the laptop style of it would at least pique and keep some of her interest. She literally played with it for five minutes and told me she didn't want it. Her 5 year old sister has a chromebook so she has no interest in it either. May be good for kids who are not used to modern devices but if your child is accustomed to any type of modern tablet/phone/etc. it is doubtful this product will hold their interest at all.

I bought the old version used, it came programmed with a name already, no big deal, had the usb to change to my little girls name, or so I thought. I plugged it into my computer and the software for this product, conveniently had been discountined. I was a little frustrated with that fact, but I saw they had made a new version and I was more than happy to spend any amount of money on it. My little girl loved the old version of this toy and I LOVED the personalization, it said your child’s name so many times, it even had emails that you could have personalized with your child’s name and 3 family members! It also had a song of your child’s name. Similar to the violet plush toy, but even more personalized. Now comes this piece of crap, you program your child’s name into it alright, once, you program it into the first letter of their name, when they press it it’ll say “that’s the first letter of your name” and spells it. It literally only spells it, it doesn’t even SAY it. Shame on you leapfrog, as a parent with a child with autism, who is constantly looking for ways to teach her to say her name, the old software/toy was going to be perfect.

Then went to a second store which carries that item and the display screen there was much better. so it seems like the screen clarity is hit or miss.

After my son received the LeapFrog Laptop as a Christmas gift a few years ago, I knew I would have to buy a second one for my daughter once she reached the appropriate age. However, I was not prepared for the updated flip-top screen. While the new screen is much brighter and more precise than the old model, the new flip feature never locks in one position, meaning the screen moves during gameplay. It frustrates my kids, and I'm honestly concerned about the device's longevity with a screen that can be on the top of the device as opposed to safely stored underneath a case/shell.",3,2022-12-9,positive

Once a child is able to do this i feel it would provide minimal fun.  I was hoping for more interactive games to teach.  Exp:  game shows a letter and encouraged the child to find it, push button, then see the animal jump and hear sounds.  Good level of voice on machine.

It’s so difficult to see the images on the screen through the touch sensors. Worse, there’s no obvious use case for the touchscreen which doesn’t even seem to work. So it’s a stupid design since the kid can barely see what’s happening. The LCD lets too much of the blue light through the pixels… like watching a dark movie on a bad LCD TV.2.

525,B06XL1B7QN,Fun but....This is a nice interactive toy but the screen is not very clear. Hard to see unless it's held at the perfect angle and even then it's not a clear resolution. The screen also swings a little too much unless it's folded pretty far back. It's meant to be used from a low angle only (like the floor) and not on a table.,4,2024-01-12,negative

And it drives all of us a bit crazy. Y. Y. Y. Y. Y. Y. WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?

However, I’m not sure if she’ll be as interested as I though- due to the sounds / volume seeming defective. There’s a video attached with this review, on the lowest volume setting, and it sounds terrible - quality is poor. Not sure if defective or how the laptop is generally. Not sure what the touch screen aspect is, it doesn’t seem to have anything that you need it for. My device also came all scratched up, as you can also see in the photos.",4,2022-12-1,negative
549,B06XL1B7QN,It's age appropriate but limits what they can do.I was a bit disappointed they only have 2 songs and it's not a touchscreen it's more like a push on the screen type.

Not the biggest attention span yet. His 4 year old and 7 year old cousins enjoyed it when they came to visit.

566,B06XL1B7QN,"Reset spring for screen to flip properly.We are enjoying this toy. Was bummed when the screen wouldn’t stay put in laptop mode. Saw a video online that showed how to remove the 5 screws on the front and back of the screen and, with the screen facing upwards in tablet mode, reset the springs, replace the white cover and screw all the screws back in. This allows the screen to flip on its own and set itself in place when the toy is opened to laptop mode or tablet mode.Was worth the discounted price given I had to fix it upon receipt. Our child enjoys playing with this toy and I’d recommend it to children that enjoy letters and numbers. The touchscreen is pretty responsive and works well.",4,2022-04-12,positive
567,B06XL1B7QN,"Decent for $20 bucks.If you’re looking for something high tech/better graphics, this is not the toy for you.

When I recieved the tablet it was obviously used, the screen was scratched up and I debated if I should return it or not. I really wanted it since they dropped it down to 18 bucks I guess the scratches was for the price break but it doesn't affect it's functionality so I save myself to hassle of returning it. I think it's cute however its a bit to advance for my 9 month old. I got because she tries to ""steal"" her siblings laptops and Ipads.

I feel the educational value is worth the money and it will grow with a 3 year old. The voice quality is clear and there are 2 volume settings. The size is perfect for little ones.

625,B06XL1B7QN,"Fun little learning laptop for kids!.My kid really loves this laptop/tablet toy. The screen gets pretty bright, so it's best not to use it in the dark for too long, but it also means that it can be used while it's bright outside and they can still see it fine. The screen is decently sized, it's fine for what it's trying to teach kids, and it's pixelated screen graphics also have a good refresh rate. It's nice that it will say the letters when pressed, and in one of the modes it will also show an animal on screen, say what kind of animal it is, and play a sound. This is good for learning the letters and about learning different animals. The touchscreen aspect isn't used a lot, but for the couple games it has where you're meant to interact with something on the screen it's used well. There's some more ""advanced"" learning too, like where it asks to find a specific letter which is also nice to see. We like that it has 2 volume modes, however do note that it does not have a mute mode. I think the learning content on this is nice, and it's a good way to introduce younger kids to the alphabet in an engaging way.",5,2025-11-27,positive
626,B06XL1B7QN,"Love it!.My 2 year old niece loved it so much as I wanted to get her learning tools rather than just toys.

The size is perfect for small hands, and it’s lightweight enough for my toddler to carry around on their own. The buttons are colorful, engaging, and easy to press, and the sounds/music are upbeat without being too loud or annoying for parents. I love that it introduces letters, numbers, and fun phrases in a way that keeps my child entertained while learning. It feels sturdy and well-made, which is a huge plus since toddlers can be a little rough with their toys. Overall, it’s the perfect mix of playful and educational—my toddler feels like they have their own “real” laptop, and I feel great knowing they’re learning while playing. Highly recommend for any parent looking for an engaging educational toy!",5,2025-09-24,positive
663,B06XL1B7QN,"My favorite kids toy by far!.This little laptop is a life saver! My son is obsessed with my laptop but since Ive gotten this one he does not touch mine. I can hear him repeat the sounds that scout is making and he is 21 months old with very little words. He stays entertained for a good while. We do not do a lot of TV and i prefer him not to be looking at a phone or iPad or any other electronic, so this feels a little safer, the screen isn't as bright and looks similar to some of the toys we had as kids. It flips around as an ""iPad"" and the screen is actually touch screen so that is pretty cool as well. The size of this is small enough to put in his little bag and he carries it around everywhere. The price on this is incredible and it will probably be my new gifts for all my friends with kids!",5,2025-09-23,positive

Its one of her favorite.Its great for learning the alphabets, numbers and not only can you use the keyboard but the screen as well.A much better option than a tablet, good size, nice handle, has songs and sounds, clear big buttons and good value for the money",5,2025-09-17,positive
668,B06XL1B7QN,OVERALL YES.This product is great especially for the cost. It’s the perfect size for toddler hands and I never originally caught onto how it flips from a computer into a tablet-style mode which was a great surprise .It’s so intricate as far as not repeating the same stuff over and over. This also works well for multiple age groups so it won’t be a toy that gets tossed in a year.  I’d definitely buy again if given the opportunity.,5,2025-09-17,positive
669,B06XL1B7QN,"My toddlers favorite toy!!.This is my 18month olds FAVORITE toy. She loves pretending to type on it and it has helped her further learn her ABCs and numbers especially with the music feature on the computer. I like how it can both be a tablet and a computer. She prefers the computer because she likes the keyboard but I can see as she gets older wanting to use the tablet version more. I purchased this truthfully because I work remotely so while mommy works on her computer, she can work on hers. It’s worked great for us and she loves it.

744,B09MW38Z5F,"Could be better.When I saw the letter tracing pages, I assumed it would detect how the letters where written and respond with feedback. Unfortunately, it's not that sophisticated. More importantly, it's really confusing how to use it properly. The instructions are useless, and we still haven't figured out how to properly engage some of the pages. There are a lot of learning materials out there, and even better ones from Leap Frog. My 4yr old can get the same lessons from books themed to his favorite Cars movie, so he prefers to use that. I have no doubt some kids will find this useful, but this just wasn't for us.",3,2022-09-5,negative

766,B09MW38Z5F,"Just use a different marker - trust me.My 3 year old loves this and we own about every laptop and tablet, sort of learning thing out there it seems.  This one is her favorite, she loves coloring and tracking the lines and says she's learning. She will sit and do this for a good 30-60 mins straight. Crazy I know, but she really likes it. Plus it's interactive it says the sounds of the letter you are tracing.Now if I could post a picture of her face that she decided to color when we weren't looking and she's never done this before, was completely blue and it was like half her face.  We washed, used dawn soap and it wasn't coming off.  We are like Oh well, lessoned learn and this pen is going in the trash.  Well, she took a bath a little later and it all came off, so that was a relief.  Just be warned, it's not easy to just wipe off or wash off in the sink, but it did ALL come off in the bath, so I guess it's washable?  I won't let her use this pen anymore because I don't want to go through that again, nor have to soak an outfit to get it to come out.Would I buy again or give as a gift - YES.",4,2022-08-9,negative
767,B09MW38Z5F,Great for preschoolers.This leap frog prep for preschool activity book comes with six different pages that are interactive. Some of the pages you write on with a dry erase marker and some of it you touch with your fingers. There are three modes-one is explore mode one is learn mode and the other is play mode.  You can use all those modes on each of the six pages. I really like that there are two different volume buttons so one is a little softer than the other. The dry erase marker that comes with this activity book is not my favorite. Once you write on the book it is very hard to get it off even right away. I wish they could have included a dry erase marker that you could erase right away or didn’t take a lot of water to rub off the ink. I tried two different other dry erase markers (from two different brands) on this book and I was able to wipe it off right away. I like the handle so my child has an easy way to carry it wherever he goes.,4,2022-07-14,negative

868,B01FVS6V9Y,Used item!!!.So displeased with this purchase. My first order never arrived for Christmas and when I received the replacement it was clearly used and not the correct item!!! I wish I could leave no stars.,1,2026-01-9,negative

870,B01FVS6V9Y,"Extremely Disappointed! Inferior Quality, Short Warranty.I purchased the VTech Touch and Learn Activity Desk Deluxe from Amazon in September 2025, and I regret it. Initially, the product worked fine, but after the batteries ran out and I replaced them with new ones, the unit completely stopped working. Despite multiple attempts using fresh, high-quality batteries, the product remains non-functional.What frustrates me even more is VTech’s response. I contacted customer support, only to find out that their warranty lasts for just 90 days from the purchase date. To put that in perspective, other toy manufacturers offer 1-year warranties, which clearly shows that VTech doesn't stand behind the long-term durability of their products. This is a glaring issue that speaks volumes about the quality—or lack thereof—of their products.It’s unacceptable that a product, which is marketed as a durable and fun educational tool for children, can stop working so soon after the warranty expires. VTech is clearly not committed to customer satisfaction or product longevity, and this short warranty period only confirms my concerns about the overall reliability of their products.I highly do not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you're looking for a long-lasting, reliable toy. My experience with the VTech Touch and Learn Activity Desk Deluxe has been a major disappointment, and I am now left with a defective product and no recourse from the company.",1,2026-01-2,negative

This item is only 7 months old.  This is the worst way to keep customers,  not standing behind your product.  I will never again buy from Vtech and considering stopping business with Amazon.

I get it that most electronic kids toys have a similar issues…but this one for me was worse bc the toy has almost zero redeeming qualities. Also, the bottom of the legs of the desk and stool slip on the floor so it’s not safe.

The hard plastic legs don't work well on a hard floor. They slide too easily so it is best to set it on carpet or a rug. The activity cards work well enough but, if she pushes too hard on a picture, as toddlers will do sometimes, the table will slide away from her. Again, hard floors don't work well with the slick plastic. The table and chair are just not very sturdy. Not a good purchase in my opinion.",2,2020-05-23,negative

It does not do much more than any other toy that tells you what letter you push, and it's really slow, and counterintuitive in such a manner as to actually teach anything.

It's an ok toy for the price, but I probably would have gone with an actual desk. Storage between the lid and the shelf is small. Also, the little buckets can only fit a few crayons or pencils, and they get caught by the lid when you open and close it, breaking the crayons in half. The kids had fun drawing on the activity cards with their markers, so I can't return the product, but I will not recommend to buy, and I will not buy again.",2,2019-12-31,negative

In theory the table has some great features, it's sturdy, cute stool, educational mats are great.

My main reason for getting it was the art easel and the other brand I intended to buy was not recommended for a 2-year-old, so I decided to buy one that was.  When it arrived my husband and I played with the educational circuit board section for an hour.  We loved it, but when we gave it to our grandson, at 2, he doesn't understand you can't rest your palms on 4 letters at a time or bang on 6 instruments.

Sometime around the middle of the year, he stopped playing with it because it became glitchy. After a change of batteries, it was still glitchy. It seems the switch that toggles between music and activity mode isn't making proper contact and it rapid cycles between the two modes, announcing it every time it changes--very annoying, as you can imagine. The warranty was only for 3 months so no help from the manufacturer. Nearly 50 bucks spent for an item that now does not perform the primary function for which it was purchased.

They do not click in like the legs on the desk, so of course the legs get pulled off a lot. The music player has a slot for a cartridge, which I didn't know about or read about until looking through the Q and A's. The only way to get the cartridge is to buy the expansions.

My kids are more interested in toys that they can make their own noises while playing. Like all other VTech toys we have owned this is loud and obnoxious.

It's cool if you always forget to turn off things or your not watching your kids because as soon as they walk away, it constantly repeats its self. Great educational toy and a slight step up from the older one. It's bigger too. Cards are not interchangeable. (I knew this beforehand and it works for me because the kids can't fight over the cards). The side holders are in shapes instead of an open trough.

There is zero tactical feedback letting them know they are unintentionally touching different buttons on the table and do not seem to care the audio response is constantly repeating that no, that was not the correct letter of the alphabet that was requested.

1107,B01FVS6V9Y,"Better for children over 3 years..I was really excited to give this to my toddler, but even though he seems to be enjoying it, I’m frustrated by how finicky it is.For example, when he’s playing the search game for the alphabet and he has to find the letter S, if he doesn’t press exactly in the middle of the letter box, it either doesn’t do anything, or it thinks he’s pressing the letter beside or beneath S. I don’t like that he’s choosing the right letter and being told he got it wrong, it doesn’t seem like that’s going to help him learn.And I wish the phone part came away from the backboard like the letter writing part does. Because when he’s trying to play “phone a friend”, if he accidentally puts his hand on the board and touches a letter when he’s reaching over to touch the numbers on the keypad, it ends the “phone a friend” game and he has to start all over again.He’s only 2 yrs 9 months, so hopefully as he gets older he’ll be better able to avoid accidentally touching letters while using the phone toy, and he’ll be able to more precisely press the letters on the board so that they actually work.",3,2020-09-11,negative

While the table has always worked and my daughter still plays with it to this day and learned from it, there is a HUGE disappointment to it. The extra Expansion Pack I bought with it back when I first purchased the table about 3 years ago, it DOES NOT WORK!! 😡😡😡 I didn't think to check to see if it worked with and was comparable with the table back when I first bought it because IT SAYS IT WAS!

I think the desk is very educational but more suited for an older kid who has patience and can press each button with one finger and wait for the voice to finish speaking and then press another letter. Right now my son just presses all the buttons and leans in and tries to touch the light screen that shows the letter and can’t wait for the voice to finish speaking.

But there is one issue I'm having with it that just turned it into a desk (for now). The issue is that it is very sensitive. Extremely slight pressure (think how sensitive a touch screen is) will set off any of the buttons.As a result it just sounds like an auctioneer with a child's voice in my living room just going off.

Also, I with it didn’t say “bye bye” when it turns off, because then I want to turn it off to save on the battery because he hadn’t been paying attention to it, when he hears the “bye bye”, he immediately goes and turns it back on again out of spite, just to not pay attention to it again after 5 min (or less)",3,2019-02-24,negative

1147,B01FVS6V9Y,"Very sensitive with touch and the pads slide out easily. Still great product though..I do love this, but I wish it came with a touch pen or something for little ones who are not so great at pointing with one finger and not touching any other part of their hand to the pad. I also wish the activity pads were able to lock in place or just not slide out so easily. If my son touches something and slides his finger a little it takes the whole pad out and then the “lady” says insert the pad over and over and over. I will say the teaching on this is amazing and I am VERY impressed with it. The lady will say it’s a red apple. Apple is red. A for Apple. Ect so it’s not just one robotic thing being said. It’s a VERY great product and would highly recommend for learning purposes. Just be aware that depending on your child, you might need to sit right there with your little one to assist with things mentioned above.",3,2018-11-3,positive

Kids love to touch everything and because this has more of a touch screen feature, I have to constantly place one of my grandson's hands away from the table and have the other hand with just the finger poking out, hover over each item to select. In my opinion, the table should have been designed to have a selection to actually press, than to touch.

My grandson keeps trying to put stuff in the disk slot. Today I learned you have to buy other learning programs to get ones with a disk.

1251,B01FVS6V9Y,"Solid buy..We got one of these about 4 years ago for our son and we have given it as a gift about four times now.It makes a great gift, and for a later birthday or Christmas you can add to the gift by getting the larger deck of cards for it.The durability it great!! We have ours set up on the back of our couch and three of my boys use it to climb on and jump off of when playing on the couch and let me tell you this thing is a survivor! My boys did crack the front of the desk and it still works! However! I dislike how the legs come off so easily. Any time it’s move or picked up the legs come off. The stools legs stay in much better then the desk.The buttons are sensitive to touch like some people say but we don’t mind that because our one year gets to play with it and it’s easy for him to use it as well. All my kids have been able to play with it at a young age because of this.  So that’s a plus for me!My biggest complaint about the desk is that when buying the larger set of cards, you have to have the little chip cards for the desk card to work. If you don’t have the chip card, like you lose it (it’s like a cassette tape), the the cards you insert won’t work. So you’d have to buy the whole card set again.As far as packaging goes, the last time we ordered I ordered frustration free and it came in a plain brown cardboard box that had the title of the desk on it. Normally I wouldn’t care at all but we bought it as a birthday gift so the packaging made it not so appealing. But! Like I said if it was just for me I wouldn’t have cared but it wasn’t.",4,2020-07-27,positive
1252,B01FVS6V9Y,Sturdy even as a 2nd owner.So far so good my son is 19’months and advance for his age. This table is a great way for him to learn and interact with the table and buttons. I got it from another mom but it’s still very sturdy as a second owner. The size of the stool and table are great and ideal for a small playroom. I will be looking for the expansion pack so he can learn more. I’m going to try the chalk and drawing part next!,4,2020-07-25,positive

I called Amazon & since the 30 day warranty was up (she has had it 2 months) they could not help me but gave me LeapFrog’s 800 number. I called them and a cracked screen voids the manufacturer’s warranty. 😳 They even put me on hold and checked with a Supervisor.  Seriously? Amazon told me it was covered. 🤷‍♀️ This product is recommended for 3-8 year olds; they are going to drop it. If the screen cracks that easily they need to make the product better.My recommendation is not to purchase this product because it is not make well enough to withstand a drop from a 3 year old.

After returning from my trip the subscription was supposedly cancelled, and the tablet was restored to the factory and returned. To my surprise, months later I’m still getting charged!?I reached out to Leapfrog customer service and no one could help due to the wrong email! I have provided the order #, phone number, the tablet’s serial #, card number that was being charged and still “they can't find any account with that information”. After multiple attempts at solving the issue with Leapfrog, I decided to go through my bank to dispute the charges. They kept $30 for the first charge, at this point I have up.

1443,B07PLG93NS,Slow loading and not a lot of content to play.The loading is so slow it almost never gets played with the battery life is short and its unable to sit for a day after being charged and turned off it won't turn on if plugged in and charged you can play immediately after charging but only an hour sometimes less not a lot of content to play so when the tablet does die he doesn't care since he is bored playing it anyways!

1444,B07PLG93NS,It didn’t work.I purchased two for both of kids and within the week the sound system blew. Both of the tablets sound system damaged my kids didn’t even get to fully enjoy. On top of that it was difficult for them to use it ages 4yrs old and 5yrs old they are both pretty tech savvy. Just be careful when buying.

He played with it for a couple of months and then it started turning off by itself, the screen would glitch and it would turn off. Finally it stopped turning on at all. I contacted Leapfrog and they said I need to replace it. They will not do anything to help because I apparently didn't buy it from an authorized seller. I bought it from Amazon directly from the leapfrog store. Watch out because they will send it to you from Amazon but the ""seller"" will never be Leapfrog.

I couldn't get a shipping label in time to get my money refunded back so I'm here to warn you .... DONT BUY IT! Get a regular tablet and just down load cocomelon, baby shark, and other learning apps for your kids with it because this isnt it! And dont get me started on the ridiculous subscription .... I'm paying for something my baby cant even use. When I finally got the tablet to come on I had to purchase more items for her to add on to play. Why? if I have a subscription it should cover it?

Once the screen cracks or breaks. No kind of warranty offered by Amazon nor the manufacturer itself can honor it. You’ll be out of $100! I purchased this tablet back in March and my son dropped it a week later and the screen broke. They couldn’t do anything.

As all their products it can take punishment w/o breaking.  It includes some basic activities but a lot of activities requires additional payment for a fee.  Toddler should be at least 3 yrs old.

She's only younger and so she doesn't get to play in discriminately, but it should be more robust than this for this price. I love the idea of the tablet that it's leapfrog learning products that you can download apps for them I like that much better for her than the Fire tablet but ultimately I would say spend the extra money and go for the fire tablet.

Also noticed the lagging in the apps and seem to slow down in response time. By November 2023, it would not charge.Purchased again (Amazon) December 2023. Within 6 months, noticed lagging again and needed more charge time even though he was on it less.  As of December into Jan 2025 (a year later), the port, again, has failed as well.Only adults are allowed to charge it. No damage etc. Two purchases with the same end results.

Do yourself a favor though, you're really only going for the learning academy, which is just a browser based portal, meaning you can literally load it on any device, I've even had it running on a fire stick with Bluetooth m+k.

We plugged it in last night after it died, it was charging, woke up this morning and it won't budge. Just got it as a replacement for the first one yesterday. Same thing happened to the last one, but after a couple weeks. I also noticed things changed from the first tablet to the second we got, stylus is different, different charger. Which shows me they're fixing ""issues"" already. Too bad they didn't fix the battery. Contacted Leapfrog originally and they told me to just return it and get a replacement where I bought it.

I can live with that, but not when it takes so long to load and crashes every other game.

We got her this for Christmas and I was reallly excited to see what she would be able to make of it as my first two kids , now teens really benefitted from using this in their formative years. Truth be told they had Leapster Explorers and one lasted up till the arrival of the LeapPad.So where is the disappointment you may ask. Well from day one we noticed that the screen proved a bit unreactive at times but we simply put it down to software challenges that work out over time. But naively we were wrong , the problem grew progressively worse to the point where the frustration made my daughter abandon the device. The simplest of strokes wouldn't elicit a response on the screen . Also frustrating has been the WiFi connectivity , its been very inconsistent and drops linkage to the LeapPad academy midgame on a regular basis. In short this turned out to be a nightmare scenario for a bitSome respite came when we switched to run the Leappad Academy from the computer and laptops for her to play the games. She is now rebuilding some desire to play the games as she progresses in a consistent manner using the mouse. She really enjoys the LeapPad Academy and this (initially 3 month free) paid platform  has proven to be  the saving grace. It hasn't assuaged my personal frustration as the whole point of creting an avenue for learning has been disrupted significantly . Which now means I have to acquire a standalone tablet to recreate the experience , or seek out an alternative which defeats the purposeThe two stars are for the software otherwise it would have been much worse.",2,2020-03-31,negative

1519,B07PLG93NS,"I would pass.I am not impressed with this tablet for multiple reasons. Time based use... this is pointless if you have more than one kid, my 2.5 year old daughter knows to just select her brothers profile when she runs out of time and vice versa. The rubber padding comes off way too easy and is essentially useless. The screen itself is terrible because unless you are directly in front of it, you can't see the screen. The problem with this is if you want to help your kid or see what they are up to, you can't both get a good view... which leads to the other problem if you have more than one kid, they fight over it because they want to watch each other play, but since they can't both see, they end up pulling at it.  Finally with all of those issues, the value is poor due to how expensive the apps are. I am a fan of other leap frog products, but I would stick to a general tablet and free source/better value apps.",2,2020-01-28,negative

However, the ""free"" apps were a total joke, not age appropriate for my 2 year old, and not fun. Without a subscription there is literally no option to download more free apps. Everything was for sale $5-25 each, and a subscription is way more than I'd be willing to pay year after year as mu toddler grows up.

My biggest and really only complaint is that the load time to turn on and get to the games is ridiculous and it DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE for the life of it. He could play with it for 30 minutes and it's already at a low battery. Does not help for long car rides.I also wish he could play games on it without us having to pay for a yearly subscription.

1558,B07PLG93NS,"It'll do.I bought this as a gift for my son's fourth birthday. I had driven myself almost crazy reading reviews and trying to decide on the best tablet for him, then finally decided on this one. I ordered a couple months ahead of time, which turned out to be an excellent idea. The first time I ordered this, the item I received had clearly already been opened and returned. The box was dented, retaped in places, and the tablet inside had been put back in upside down. The return process through Amazon was fast, thankfully, and I got the replacement within a few days.Having read other reviews, I made sure to open the tablet and have it all registered and set up before wrapping it for my son's birthday. I also hijacked it and added the Amazon app store using fairly easy instructions I found online, then added some other apps I'd read about and researched. I made sure to download everything I could, since one of the main reasons to buy a tablet like this was for entertainment in the car during an upcoming road trip. It worked great for that, and we took an extra long charger cord for use in the car as well.As to the actual quality of the tablet.... I'd say it's a good starter tablet if your child has never used another tablet before. If your child is used to the speed of a fire or ipad, they'll get frustrated with this one. I get frustrated myself with the length of time it takes to do basic things (ie: turning on). The touchscreen is also not that sensitive, and I find myself having to tap repeatedly to get a simple function to work. I originally set up the time limits to be very conservative but after about a month, maybe 6 weeks, I found myself turning them off completely. My son never met the time limits, much less exceeded them, and having them set was getting irritating. I think the timer count starts as soon as the tablet is woken up for the day? Which is ridiculous. My son would play with it for ten minutes, then come back a few hours later and it would tell him he'd exceeded his time. Which is why we found ourselves constantly overriding it and eventually turned off the limits completely. I did keep the parental controls as far as internet access and the app store because dude will definitely buy himself ALL the Lego apps if he could. Which are ridiculously overpriced, as are all Legos, but that's neither here nor there for this review.The leapfrog app options are ridiculous and I honestly thought there would be more free or cheap ones but there aren't. And my son isn't into any of the characters that seem to be popular on the Leapfrog app store. Which is why I basically rooted the durn thing.The price of this tablet is pretty high compared to what you get (slow speeds, price gouging on apps, etc) and compared to similar tablets elsewhere (my husband bought a renewed fire tablet for $60 that works amazingly great and might be the next tablet we get our son).",3,2022-11-11,positive

It says it comes with learning and games but you have to pay extra which I paid an additional $67 for 12 months + 3 free months.  My grandson liked it but broke the charger in the first 2 weeks.  I would have thought it would be more childproof.,3,2020-01-11,negative
1591,B07PLG93NS,"Kids-ready tablet, but expensive & outdated.I was very excited about this LeapFrog LeapPad tablet for our son to play with. And he does enjoy playing with it. However, for $160 I would only recommend this to someone with no technology inclination whatsoever who wants a ready to go technology toy.Here's why: LeapPad is very easy to set up, comes preloaded with a handful of games and is generally ""kid proof"" right out of the box.Unfortunately, that's where positives end. The 7"" screen is of such poor quality that you have to be looking at it perfectly straight on to avoid distortion. Oh and it's worse in portrait mode than landscape and also worse at higher brightness. The device also runs on top of a very old ""neutered"" version of Android 4.4. It came out ~6 years ago and Google stopped releasing updates for it (including key *security* updates) almost 5 years ago. Given that this device relies on WiFi connectivity and will likely travel with the child to various WiFi networks (e.g. restaurants, hotels, airports, etc) this device has decent potential to get infected with something nasty and then spread it to other systems. I work in IT Security and a device running Android 4.4 would never be allowed on a corporate network these days.LeapPad does have a web browser and a couple of other regular tablet features in ""parent"" mode. They are pretty mediocre by today's standards. It also does include a handful of games and they're quite fun but it's pretty clear from using the device that it's really not going to entertain kids for very long and they're really trying to get you to sign up for LeapPad academy ($9.99/mth or a bit less for a yearly subscription).Now, say you accept this cost as the games are quite good. In that case, LeapFrog academy supports a multitude of devices, including Amazon Fire tablets. You can get a new Amazon Fire 7 tablet with a much better screen, dimensions and running a much newer version of Android (7.1 I believe) for $69.99. That $100 you're saving can buy you a super sturdy case for it and almost cover a year of LeapPad academy! And no offense to LeapFrog, but I have a lot of faith in Amazon's application & device security practices. It's going to be much better at being a tablet than LeapPad in every way but is still not running a full version of Android. You can get that full version of Android in a Samsung Galaxy Tab E lite or in a clearance model of a Samsung Galaxy tablet, likely running Android 8 or newer for around $140 - still cheaper than LeapPad. Want to spend even less? Take a look at some well rated ""no name"" tablets - they can be quite decent.You would then have to set up parental controls on either Amazon Fire or another tablet to make it kid-safe. This is relatively easy to do by following online tutorials but I recognize that this still may be an issue for folks and thus would be the main situation where LeapPad comes out on top.As for me, even though we have this LeapPad already, I don't want it on my Wi-Fi network. I've put it on my guest network for now but we'll likely go down the Amazon Fire 7 route in the future. And I'm thinking that LeapFrog Academy subscription will be worth the money in a few months to get our son to interact with (and learn from) some very well-made educational games!",3,2019-08-31,negative

1593,B07PLG93NS,"Amazing product, but kind of expensive product for limited games..Love this item! Love how personalized you can make it and my 3 year old loves it!Reasons for 4 stars and not 5 is the battery life is ok, but needs charged after several hours. Got it for long car rides to visit family a few times a year and need to charge it before the car ride home. Also, since my daughter is 3, she doesn’t hard power it down when she’s done with it and that seems to drain the battery if not used for a while.Other reason would be that yes, it’s made for learning, and yes, she maybe does learn a little bit, but not sure how much actual learning she’s getting from it instead of just playing around.Not a whole lot of games without a subscription. Expensive product for just a handful of learning games unless you want to pay an expensive subscription for a plethora of games.Has given hours of distraction on car rides and definitely love the product. Kind of expensive but I got it on a Black Friday sale when it was 50 percent off and that felt more worth it to me. Do wish it had more game options without a subscription.",4,2025-08-8,positive

1598,B07PLG93NS,"Great for 4 year old.My daughter was using my tablet before this, but we are trying to teach her better behaviors. So I looked into a more educational tablet and this was perfect. It’s your typical kid tablet so don’t expect too much. You get the academy cheaper with the tablet, the year is your best save. Came with 3 months free! Easy set up and daughter finds it easy to use. Love that it has stylus pen connected to it. If you want more of the unique apps like paw patrol, frozen, you do have to pay extra for them. But remember this should be more for educational anyways. So I got her the academy and the free apps that come with it. The charge does go down even when you’re not playing on it, so just remember to put it on at night when everyone goes to bed.  Sound is loud enough. Easy to carry for her. Cute appearance. She starts 4-K soon so wanted to get her a head start!",4,2024-07-9,positive
1599,B07PLG93NS,"Great for three year olds..I got this tablet because my daughter was watching way too many YouTube kids videos and I couldn’t get the parental controls to actually work effectively. (Which if you know, some of the videos on YouTube kids can be kind of weird or encourage behavior you don’t necessarily want your kid to replicate).I think the cost is totally fair, it has a bunch of fun games through the monthly membership which I am comfortable paying for. (Most of the apps my daughter did enjoy on my iPad were a monthly subscription anyway, and again you get more bang for your buck with the leapfrog tablet). It’s super easy to use, my daughter has figured out most of the games herself and really enjoys that it has a music player, books, and puzzle/sticker games. It feels sturdy, which is good because my daughter is fairly clumsy and drops a lot of items without meaning to.The parental controls are awesome. It took forever to download the Amazon App Store. I was able to add Amazon prime video for cartoons, and a few games she enjoyed from the App Store. Kind of difficult to figure out how to get this added, but I’m okay with that as I was looking for a tablet with parental controls that were hard to get around.My review would be five stars if it wasn’t for the battery life. Not sure if it’s because she has games from the Amazon App Store or not, but it does die within 1 day. Not a huge issue as I can just charge it at the end of the night, but it’s advertised to last a few days rather than just the one. The sound quality is also kind of poor, but that’s not a huge issue for my daughter. (Have yet to try it with headphones).Great purchase, though. Would definitely buy again.",4,2024-06-14,positive

La he comprado en dos ocasiones y mi hijo ha aprendido mucho con ella. Pero lo malo es que se daña rápido, el área del puerto de carga, no se porque empieza a fallar y dejar de cargar. Recomiendo que le pongas seguro si la deseas ya que te devuelven el dinero si se daña la unidad. La primera unidad que compre se dañó como a los 6 a 8 meses y la segunda unidad la tengo hace 3 meses y está empezando a dar problemas para cargarla.",4,2023-06-10,negative
1602,B07PLG93NS,"Educational, fun, expensive, cheap device, get warranty.I had it for over a year now and it has pros and cons.The device itself is cheap, I had to return the first one because it quickly had issues with charger port. I was gracious for amazon replacing it so I got the warranty for the second one, which I recommend because I had to exchange it again because it just suddenly would  not hold a charge. Also it will freeze semi frequently, kids always panic lol. So far a restart fixes it.Positives is that the kids really love the games they are expensive, and almost no games are included with set up. The cheapest games are 10$ and go to 25$ and they offer bundles of like 4 games for 20-30$ but never the good games are included. They have sales on major holidays so that helps save money.The device and its games really are fun and educational. They make learning easy and fun, it's a great way to distract you kids and know the content is safe.I dislike that leap pad pushes the heck out of there popular games with ads so kids are never content and always wanting more more more...I also dislike that the main learning game ''Academy'' is a yearly subscription on 40.$$$ which I bought for my 3 and 4 year old and they almost never used. Now it's expired they are 4 and 5 now and love it. I DO like that you can use the academy game on your cell phone as well as the device and it syncs your progress.I really dislike that it requires sooooo much money to get a good group of games. The description of the games on the web page are terrible and there are no refunds if you download a game you don't like.I wanted to give 3 stars because the device is cheap, I got over 200$ invested in just games and then it stops working... exhausting and disappointing.I gave it 4 stars because the kids really love it and DO get a lot out of it.

We put a screen protector on it. Our toddler is ROUGH with everything and so far nothing has broken or even scratched. The battery also lasts a pretty good while.Cons: The free apps are pretty lame and she never plays with those at all. One is a calculator, another is a notes app,  a few are demos- but then there are some games too. It’s more worth it if you pay for the Academy apps.The apps are visually ugly.

You can download paw patrol or other videos off the App Store (we got 3 episodes for $7.50). The green bumper and kickstand that comes on the device can be easily taken off especially by kids and the kickstand can pop off to, not hard to put back on but wish it didn’t remove at all one more thing to lose.

1620,B07PLG93NS,"Can be used offline, sturdy, but not very intuitive..I bought this for my six year old niece and one of the best attributes was that it could be used offline as well.  Up to about 25 games can be downloaded for offline use.  They don't have internet so this was especially important.  Honestly, I was surprised at how sturdy it felt in my hands, fat and bump resistant with the rubber case that came with it.  So I had a lot of confidence it will hold up.  Also since they don't have internet, I actually charged it, downloaded a couple dozen games and updated the software, (twice before I actually got the gift to her).  Graphics were better than I expected, connected to internet and speed was as good as my ""real"" tablet.  With that said, I did get frustrated trying to find the games and even after having done it once, it was difficult to find when I tried to add some additional games again later.  It just didn't see very intuitive to me.  Finally did get it done, got it to her and she loves it.

1633,B07PLG93NS,"Best Learning Tablet Ever!.This is one of my favorite educational toys ever. We've owned LeapPads in the past, but this thing is on a whole new level. The apps that come with it are great, but my preschooler really loves the Academy app. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that LeapFrog gave us a free 3 month trial of their Academy app with the tablet, but my little one loved it so much that I went ahead and subscribed to it for a year. (the yearly price is VERY reasonable; especially if you homeschool like us and are used to buying extremely expensive curriculum) While set-up was super easy, I skipped a few steps and could not figure out how to get back to where I accessed my 3 free months of the Academy app. I contacted CS and they replied with very detailed instructions of how to get back to the step I missed. While waiting for them to reply, I grew impatient with my kids begging to use the new LeapPad that I just did a factory reset and started over again. Took me just a few minutes to set it up and the kids even less time to figure out how to work the tablet. It seems to be very durable and I love that the stylus pen stores in the protective bumper. I wish I had 3 of these because my kids (ages 4, 6, and 8) constantly fight over this thing! They all think they're so grown up using it because it's a legit Android-based tablet and does not look like a cheap, bulky, plastic encased toy. I use it as a bargaining tool; finish your lessons and chores and you get to play on the LeapPad first. :-) Other homeschooling parents ask us all the time what curriculum they should buy for their preschoolers. I always, always, always tell them to skip the expensive curriculum when the kids are that little and get them a LeapPad or other LeapFrog toys to let them play while they learn and inspire future school success. This thing is more than perfect for that. I am removing 1 star because the shatter-safe screen is hard to view from certain angles. You need to have it positioned just right to focus on what you're viewing. This is a problem when multiple kids are trying to view the screen at the same time. Also, something is up with the camera app. No matter how we rotate the screen, the image is captured upside down. I'm sure it's an easy fix from the app developers, but it's super frustrating for my little ones who love to walk around taking pics of literally everything. Lastly, the headphone jack will not work with my little one's safe volume headphones, but it will work with my ear buds. It can get kind of annoying for us parents who have to listen to every little sound that's coming out of the tablet when the kids are playing. Overall, we all love the LeapPad Academy learning tablet and highly recommend it for educational play for all kids from about 3 to 8 years old. The product has been provided by VTech/LeapFrog free of charge so I could experience it with my family; however, the thoughts and opinions are all my own.",4,2019-09-5,positive

It’s been dropped off counters, dressers and down the stairs 🤦🏻‍♀️ and it’s still kicking.I should note that this tablet CANNOT download mainstream apps (YouTube, Nextflix, Disney Plus) but with going through the Amazon AppStore we were able to find apps that would let you access them.The battery lasts (at 100%) anywhere from 2hrs-4hrs or more if lucky with constant use. I also noticed it’s a little slow at times depending on what you’re doing, not all the time but with bigger webpages.It’s not bad for the price, but if you’re looking for a tablet with more of a “AppStore” and more mainstream functions then I suggest buying an iPad.Leapfrog games are super educational and even tho it’s not a highend tablet my sons still able to have fun and watch YouTube videos (which was the initial reason for buying)The case comes off for easy cleaning which has a sturdy stand, the speakers are loud & it also has a 3.5mm Jack for headphones.Overall it’s not bad, but it’s not great.

There are parent controls and parent portals and we spent quite a bit of time setting things up.My older daughter lost interest quickly as this LeapFrog Leappad is definitely geared more towards ages 3 to 6 in my opinion.",4,2019-10-19,positive
1651,B07PLG93NS,"Good learning tablet to start at early age.My 5 year old was using iPad for various learning games and videos, but he recently broke iPad. This time I did not want to give him expensive thing like iPad and LeapFrog leapPad perfectly fits the bill.It is not that expensive and made very sturdy. Tablet is covered in rubber guard case and feels well designed and sturdy. It comes with nice stylus and kick stand to keep tablet on desk. We were impressed as soon as we opened the box we were impressed with high quality hardware. However as soon as we turned the tablet ON, we were little disappointed. Screen is not as high quality as iPad and viewing angle is very poor. You need to be perfectly viewing straight. The display seems mediocre which is expected at this price point. I am not sure if LeapFrog made it in this way to protect kids eyes. My son did not mind it and did not notice much difference.With excitement, my son started exploring included games and application and in fe days, he got bored with it. Most applications are below his age and does not interest him very long. He wanted his iPad back because it was loaded with lots of learning and fun applications. You can download and buy new applications from Leapfrog store, but they seemed quite expensive. To keep interest going, I signed up for 3 months free trial for LeapFrog Academy and honestly it his hard to keep his interest going on with it. There are few reasons behind it: (1) For kids who cannot read yet, it’s not intuitive to scan through all the contents and try it out. So he needs parent support. (2) Content is not very polished yet. For example, reading the book. when you ask to read to kids, it is way too fast. (3) His familiarity with iPad and Apple Ecosystem may be pushing him back because he is not familiar with Android system.I will keep involved with him to get his interest going and see how it goes. It should be mentioned that LeaFrog Academy costs $7.99/month and can be used on any device.Overall, I thing this is great started tablet and still think that if I had a choice earlier I would have started with this rather than iPad since it is meant for kids and slowly transition him to expensive options such as iPad when he grows up.Overall, I think it is good learning tablet to start at early age.",4,2019-09-29,negative
1652,B07PLG93NS,"Good tablet, requires subscription.Like most things these days, unfortunately this tablet requires a monthly subscription in only to access LeapFrog Academy. LeapFrog Academy is an online-only service that is a digital world where your child can create an only avatar and complete different levels, working themselves through a map of different lessons.For the most part, this tablet would prefer to have internet access at all times. Luckily enough, you can save up to 24 lessons by favouriting them for offline use. This tablet does have an integrated Parental Control mode that allows you to limit access to applications, or set availability of the device.Because this is used by kids, this tablet is very rugged. The screen is plastic and there is a rubber case that will protect the tablet when it is inevitably dropped. It is very hard to crack a plastic screen, just be wary that it will scratch.Overall, this is quite good value considering the integrated applications. It is disappointing to see that there is a subscription for the Academy, however I understand that it costs money to run their servers.",4,2019-09-11,negative
1653,B07PLG93NS,"Good content. Hardware is sturdy but screen is awful..I like that the LeapPad is very simple to use. It comes with a whole bunch of games out of the box and is kid-proof both in terms of the content and durability. Content is locked down tightly and the bumpers are good enough to withstand moderate drops or bumps. The kickstand is pretty durable and does a good job even on carpet.The screen is quite awful and washed out but does the job for kid use... it gets pretty washed out if you want to look at the screen together though.You'll need to subscribe to the Academy to make the most of this tablet. The three month trial included is appreciated and you can make up your mind for yourself. It's a pretty reasonably priced in my opinion but the content is really geared towards younger kids.I think that if you think of this as a tablet and compare it against the Fire tablet, you'll be sorely disappointed. But if you compare this against a string of $75 playsets, you'll find that this is a terrific value.",4,2019-09-7,positive
1654,B07PLG93NS,"Perfect For Preschoolers, Pricey App Store.For its price point, this is a pretty good tablet. It comes with all you need to get started, including protective bumpers and a stylus. I call them bumpers because it is definitely not a case. I haven’t tried throwing it down the stairs but I don’t think that I can trust this silicone case for rough play. The tablet slides out of the case quite easily. There is a stand on the back of the case. The stylus is attached by a short cord and slides into the side of the tablet for storage. The usb port, micro SD slot, headphone jack, power and volume buttons are all located on the top of the tablet and not covered by the case. I don’t think it’s a great idea to make the micro SD slot that easily accessible to kids, I would have hidden it in a different place.The tablet works right out of the box. It is preloaded with some apps and others can be added. I’m pretty tech savvy and I still had to play around with this tablet to really understand how to get it going. I had to sign into my leapfrog account (or sign up for one if you don’t have one) and then set the limitations for the children using the tablet. You can set up a profile for multiple children and monitor pretty much everything from screen time to what they’re looking at.My children have specific apps that they love. Netflix, youtubekids, and roblox are the most important ones. Roblox can be downloaded through the amazon app store, but netflix has to be done differently. I still cannot get youtube kids on the tablet. The amazon app store is accessible through the parent portal of the tablet. The instructions that come with the leappad are very vague and I found myself online looking for videos on how to access and download different apps. Keep in mind though, that the leapfrog approved babysitting service isn’t available for the netflix app if you should download it. Your child will have access to everything.I think the leapfrog app store is expensive, more so than others. You get a three month subscription to the leapfrog academy included with the purchase of this tablet and after that it costs eight dollars a month. It’s basically a subscription to ongoing age appropriate school lessons. If you choose not to continue with your subscription, you can still access other apps on the tablet. So no, it doesn’t render the tablet useless.The home screen is pretty interactive, and it is really easy to navigate. There is also a voice that explains things as you go. There is a camera on the front and back of the unit, pictures are good quality. The screen is okay, it’s said to be shatter resistant. You have to look at it straight on, or you can’t see what’s on it very well. It makes sharing difficult.The recommended age for this tablet is three to eight. I think its definitely more suitable for preschool and not for older kids. My older kids were over it very quickly and didn’t have much interest in the baby apps it came with (their words, not mine). The leapfrog approved content is good, but very basic so more geared towards younger. My younger kids were happy with exploring this and find it easy to play, they used the stylus a lot.Overall, I think this is a good tablet if you have a younger child and are on a budget. My children have been using ipads from the get-go and I can set a lot of the same restrictions on those with more options as far as apps go. I find the leappad extremely limited. Which is good or bad depending on who you’re purchasing it for.",4,2019-08-31,negative

You can plug in headphones for the noise too! Excellent way to get ready for preschool and do do something other than watch TV which will help them learn! We charge at night so charging time isn’t an issue. Screen quality is good. It is slower than the modern computers and smart phones but doesn’t affect use or function.

Just don’t forget to get a case for it!

1675,B07PLG93NS,"Very excited grandparent.I could not be more pleased.  As a grandparent who wants to help grow and nurture little minds, Leapfrog was the answer.  We were looking for something we, his parents and I, could download apps. I was going to use an old Kindle of mine but it was fried.  I started looking at another Kindle BUT when I started reading reviews on the horrors of parental controls I became discouraged. Then a friend reminded me of Leapfrog.  OMG! I had totally forgotten about it. So I researched them, figured out the best one and we are thrilled.  Not only does it come with everything to get started BUT it comes with bonuses like, within 24 hours of use knows the child is left handed and moved everything to the other side of the screen out of his way, no settings had to be set up for that, thank you Leapfrog.  I have to add my grandson is only 20 months old. He's already working on phonics, language and writing.  The other plus so far is the limited access to WiFi.  His parents are excited about that.  So a big THANK YOU Leapfrog.",5,2025-06-14,positive

1678,B07PLG93NS,No inappropriate adds or app purchases.So far I like it. I don't have to worry about in app purchases or whatever like on other tablets. I don't have inappropriate adds. I don't have to worry about them finding something bad on it. I was hesitant to get it the bc of how much it is. But it is nice to be able to let them play on educational games while I finish school with another child if its a particular long day. Or on a long road trip. I don't know how long it will last. My only complaint is not all the games I have will play on the other ultimates or leapfrog pads. Or vice versa. Otherwise. If you are looking for something safer ti let your kid loose on this works for me.,5,2025-05-2,positive

1683,B07PLG93NS,"Years of learning.This was a gift for a little later on for my great nephew but I probably won’t be here to see him use it so I wanted to buy now because I won’t be here later. I thought it would be good for him to start learning on it and get used to it and grow into it and grow with it because there is so much that it does and it will last for so long and he can use for gaming and watching movies as well as using it for learning and it will advance as he does and that’s the nice thing about it, it goes at your child’s pace. It’s bright and attractive so it catches the eye and draws a child’s attention so they want to play with it because it’s colorful and it does so many things and different things. . It has great sound, apparently it’s freeze resistant, the size is good for kids and there are guards on the sides to protect it if it’s dropped, they were thinking of kids or me when they designed this. You can get cases for these too in assorted colors and styles. Now you can start when they’re young and let them get used to it because it works with them on their level and progresses with them so it sort of grows with them and adapts along with them. The features are pretty amazing. I bought one of these for my stepdaughter over 20 years ago and they have come a long way but they were still very impressive then and that’s why I bought this one for my nephew because they are a great learning tool.",5,2025-04-2,positive
1684,B07PLG93NS,"It’s really a kid friendly tablet..I don’t allow my children to have tablets and iPads due to the lack of parenting controls. The access to brain rot such as coco melon , YouTube shorts, the brain rot you see on YouTube kids even. This is totally different. They replaced brain rot apps and videos with learning videos full of skills to teach before or even while they’re ins school. My son is 7 and we can switch the profile to more age appropriate for him, while not having to stress him watching nonsense. It helps keep him ahead for school, & we can still moderate the time as well. If you’re a parenting parent, 10/10 recommend",5,2025-03-22,positive
1685,B07PLG93NS,"Great for toddlers first iPad!!.This leapfrog leap pad does what it should. Long lasting battery life= long lasting fun and learning. It was very easy to set up. Parent control. It has decent amount of storage. My 4 year old son loves it. It has different apps and also demos. You have the option to buy games on the leapfrog app store. Also you can purchase leapfrog academy for $30 a year. Definitely worth it as it teaches your child from pre-k to grade 12. You can set what school level there at and it shows what games they can play. Pre-k games are like matching colors and shapes, counting, tracing letters and ect. They also can watch videos. More fun for a visual learner with counting it shows the numbers while they count. It has perfect brightness and sound. It is freeze resistant depending on the wifi connection. It's just as described. It doesn't come with headphones. Also it doesn't have Bluetooth. But I recommend it has a lot for the price.

So we wanted to get our daughter a newer one.Our daughter loves this tablet and we love playing the games together. She has fun navigating through all the games and found a good handful of apps she enjoys the most right now, the camera, art studio, a coloring page one, a food truck one, word of the day and a few others that you interact with animals and one app that has a whole bunch of videos and learning songs. Some of the games you have to pick right answers to get to the next part to continue the fun, which we help her with, but I like that it includes some learning activity questions into the games as you continue playing.There is a parent control where you can set a time limit for the tablet, which was one reason for purchasing, haven’t had to use it yet.The sound is great, you can use your tablet pen or finger on the screen, very easy to use!We also purchased the screen protector and tablet case for it.",5,2024-05-17,positive

1725,B07PLG93NS,Quality product with tons of learning activities.My son loves it. Great addition to learning outside the classroom. LeapPad does offer two options for their subscription service. I opted for the $30 per year instead of $6 or $7 monthly. Easy setup and not heavy at all for a younger child to handle.  Love the flexibility of parental controls. Charging time is good. Easy to use and delivered on time. Packaged well in manufacturer packaging and Amazon box.,5,2024-03-18,positive
1726,B07PLG93NS,Love this!.Purchased for 5 year old boy. He hasn’t put it down for more than a few minutes since I gave it to him. He loves it! Uses it to expand his learning experience and for casual use as well. Definitely worth the buy!,5,2024-03-15,positive

1732,B07PLG93NS,"4.5 stars.I like this tablet for my almost 3 year old. He had a Kindle tablet that a friend got him (against my wishes lol) and I really dislike that tablet. He gets really crazy when I take the Kindle away and somehow he gets on YouTube and finds Cartoon Network Adult Swim or other weird videos. With the Leappad, he can't do that. There are some videos from some of the apps I downloaded, but most are educational. I would take away a star because the apps are kind of expensive and Leappad Academy isn't cheap either. I'm not saying it's too expensive and that it's not worth it, it is worth it, but the apps should be more affordable for people who buy the tablet. Especially individual apps. I was honestly pretty surprised at how much I had to spend for just a handful of apps. Despite this, my loathing towards the Kindle tablet prevents me from taking a star away lol. Also, I've noticed that my son isn't crazy attached to the Leappad like he is with the Kindle. I let him play with the Leappad when he wants throughout the day, and he doesn't sit on it all day. He also doesn't freak out if I take it from him to do something else. He totally melts down if I take the Kindle from him. To me, that's another big plus in favor of the Leappad. He doesn't seem obsessed or addicted to it.",5,2024-01-26,negative

Beyond this, the actual concept is nice with 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, children email writing, and songs, but there's not much here that you wouldn't find in almost any other children's toy (maybe like 30-40 permutations of songs/activities/etc) but since you can't see anything anyways, it's much more frustrating for the child than fun and you'll get alot of anger/crying with it.

My son was actually in tears trying to figure out how to put a space between words. Anyone with a toddler knows how easily frustrated they get. I do not blame him here.

1843,B06XL1B7QN,VERY DISAPPOINTED.I was very disappointed. I had shopped early for my granddaughters birthday present.  I found this great deal on Amazon for a refurbished Leap Frog learning toy for toddlers.  I felt confident that everything would work and be fine only to find out this weekend when I gave the present to her that the screen will not stay flipped to the correct side when the toy is open. Very sad to have to take a toy away from a toddler.  I would have thought that these things would be checked out before reselling a used item. I was sure it would have been sanitized and looked over for defects. Now I see I cannot even return it because the return date has passed.,1,2022-06-7,negative
1844,B06XL1B7QN,NOT GOOD DESIGN.I am very disappointed in the flip design on the screen. The laptop opening and closing isn’t the issue it’s the screen part that rotates 360 that is not good.

What I notice was the hook where you would lift up the laptop up. I believe that pops off and that’s the problem, I could be wrong all I know it’s very annoying problem.

1898,B06XL1B7QN,PARENTS BE AWARE OF MUSIC MODE.I have to write this review on my laptop however I am warning all parents of the music mode touch screen. As parents know children soak things up as a sponge soaks up water. They have big imaginations and tend to emulate what they see. I am big on a child remaining as a child and not being a raunchy adult. There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion. Yes its a great tool to help them learn but be vigilant because if not monitored could easily introduce vulgar and inapropriate movements in your child. Not surprising considering Netflix and cuties and now people trying to force children to make adult decisions at school..... Ima leave it there...,2,2022-11-7,negative

At 4 years old I'm not ready to buy her a laptop or even a chromebook yet. I though this would be a great way to allow her to play pretend while also learning with an interactive toy. The problem is, she had absolutely no interest in it. To be fair, she uses a Kindle Fire and has an old iPhone, which are obviously more advanced than this product. However, I thought the laptop style of it would at least pique and keep some of her interest. She literally played with it for five minutes and told me she didn't want it. Her 5 year old sister has a chromebook so she has no interest in it either. May be good for kids who are not used to modern devices but if your child is accustomed to any type of modern tablet/phone/etc. it is doubtful this product will hold their interest at all.

I bought the old version used, it came programmed with a name already, no big deal, had the usb to change to my little girls name, or so I thought. I plugged it into my computer and the software for this product, conveniently had been discountined. I was a little frustrated with that fact, but I saw they had made a new version and I was more than happy to spend any amount of money on it. My little girl loved the old version of this toy and I LOVED the personalization, it said your child’s name so many times, it even had emails that you could have personalized with your child’s name and 3 family members! It also had a song of your child’s name. Similar to the violet plush toy, but even more personalized. Now comes this piece of crap, you program your child’s name into it alright, once, you program it into the first letter of their name, when they press it it’ll say “that’s the first letter of your name” and spells it. It literally only spells it, it doesn’t even SAY it. Shame on you leapfrog, as a parent with a child with autism, who is constantly looking for ways to teach her to say her name, the old software/toy was going to be perfect. This “personalization” on this new toy is cheap and lazy and ridiclous.",2,2018-11-18,negative

However, I was not prepared for the updated flip-top screen. While the new screen is much brighter and more precise than the old model, the new flip feature never locks in one position, meaning the screen moves during gameplay. It frustrates my kids, and I'm honestly concerned about the device's longevity with a screen that can be on the top of the device as opposed to safely stored underneath a case/shell.",3,2022-12-9,positive

My I, J and K buttons all say I. Oops.But again, for $18 to distract a baby on a long road trip, it’ll do.

I did feel that much fun would come from this for a younger child who died not even recognize a letter or number.  Would not be able to create a text when not able to identify letters.  Once a child is able to do this i feel it would provide minimal fun.  I was hoping for more interactive games to teach.  Exp:  game shows a letter and encouraged the child to find it, push button, then see the animal jump and hear sounds.  Good level of voice on machine.

2016,B06XL1B7QN,"So much potential hurt by usability.There are so many great things about this toy, but a few key drawbacks make it almost unusable.1. Contrast is terrible. It’s so difficult to see the images on the screen through the touch sensors. Worse, there’s no obvious use case for the touchscreen which doesn’t even seem to work. So it’s a stupid design since the kid can barely see what’s happening. The LCD lets too much of the blue light through the pixels… like watching a dark movie on a bad LCD TV.2. Volume only has two settings.",3,2022-07-3,negative
2017,B06XL1B7QN,"Better in tablet mode.I really like the games for my 2 year old son. The only issue is the screen didn’t stay in place when you are using it as a laptop.

2034,B06XL1B7QN,Safety.I’m always on my computer for work & my son taps or beats on my laptop all day so this was the perfect gift at 12 months. He really enjoys it. The only dislike is that parents you have to watch them playing with this toy  because their tiny hands can get stuck in middle of the screen flipper & then they close the computer with their hands stuck.

2126,B06XL1B7QN,"Works as expected.I almost didn't order due to many reviews suggesting that the screen itself is dysfunctional and won't stay in place but I took the chance anyway. I have since found that you have to angle the screen a little more than 90° in order for it to stay put. Maybe it could've been designed a little better but knowing this, I have no issue with the product.",4,2022-12-8,negative

And it drives all of us a bit crazy. Y. Y. Y. Y. Y. Y. WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY? WHY?

However, I’m not sure if she’ll be as interested as I though- due to the sounds / volume seeming defective. There’s a video attached with this review, on the lowest volume setting, and it sounds terrible - quality is poor. Not sure if defective or how the laptop is generally. Not sure what the touch screen aspect is, it doesn’t seem to have anything that you need it for. My device also came all scratched up, as you can also see in the photos.",4,2022-12-1,negative
2129,B06XL1B7QN,It's age appropriate but limits what they can do.I was a bit disappointed they only have 2 songs and it's not a touchscreen it's more like a push on the screen type.

Not the biggest attention span yet. His 4 year old and 7 year old cousins enjoyed it when they came to visit. I was shocked when the 4 year old counted along with it so well.The only big downside to this is the screen is very dark so it’s hard for the children to see what’s going on.",4,2022-09-22,positive

2146,B06XL1B7QN,"Reset spring for screen to flip properly.We are enjoying this toy. Was bummed when the screen wouldn’t stay put in laptop mode. Saw a video online that showed how to remove the 5 screws on the front and back of the screen and, with the screen facing upwards in tablet mode, reset the springs, replace the white cover and screw all the screws back in. This allows the screen to flip on its own and set itself in place when the toy is opened to laptop mode or tablet mode.Was worth the discounted price given I had to fix it upon receipt. Our child enjoys playing with this toy and I’d recommend it to children that enjoy letters and numbers. The touchscreen is pretty responsive and works well.",4,2022-04-12,positive
2147,B06XL1B7QN,"Decent for $20 bucks.If you’re looking for something high tech/better graphics, this is not the toy for you. If your kiddo likes computers, merely to carry around and play silly games on, this is right up the ballpark. Black and white screen, with pixel style graphics, reminds me of toys from my childhood.

When I recieved the tablet it was obviously used, the screen was scratched up and I debated if I should return it or not. I really wanted it since they dropped it down to 18 bucks I guess the scratches was for the price break but it doesn't affect it's functionality so I save myself to hassle of returning it. I think it's cute however its a bit to advance for my 9 month old. I got because she tries to ""steal"" her siblings laptops and Ipads.

I feel the educational value is worth the money and it will grow with a 3 year old. The voice quality is clear and there are 2 volume settings. The size is perfect for little ones.

2205,B06XL1B7QN,"Fun little learning laptop for kids!.My kid really loves this laptop/tablet toy. The screen gets pretty bright, so it's best not to use it in the dark for too long, but it also means that it can be used while it's bright outside and they can still see it fine. The screen is decently sized, it's fine for what it's trying to teach kids, and it's pixelated screen graphics also have a good refresh rate. It's nice that it will say the letters when pressed, and in one of the modes it will also show an animal on screen, say what kind of animal it is, and play a sound. This is good for learning the letters and about learning different animals. The touchscreen aspect isn't used a lot, but for the couple games it has where you're meant to interact with something on the screen it's used well. There's some more ""advanced"" learning too, like where it asks to find a specific letter which is also nice to see. We like that it has 2 volume modes, however do note that it does not have a mute mode. I think the learning content on this is nice, and it's a good way to introduce younger kids to the alphabet in an engaging way.",5,2025-11-27,positive
2206,B06XL1B7QN,"Love it!.My 2 year old niece loved it so much as I wanted to get her learning tools rather than just toys.

2240,B06XL1B7QN,"Great toy!.This has been a favorite of my granddaughters since the day we bought it. She loves to sit next to mom and do work on her laptop, too. This is also a great one to take along in the car or to restaurants.",5,2025-09-27,positive
2241,B06XL1B7QN,"Highly recommend.This little laptop has been such a great educational toy. My two year old sings her ABC's and counts to 20 thanks to this thing. It's great. She loves the different games available as well. It's easy for her to operate and small enough that she can move it around with ease. It is also super easy to clean, as we've had to clean crayon off the screen already. The screen wasbt damaged from the drawing or the cleaning either.",5,2025-09-25,positive
2242,B06XL1B7QN,"Engaging for a busy two year old! 10/10 recommend.This toddler learning laptop / tablet has been such a fun and educational toy for my 2 year old! The size is perfect for small hands, and it’s lightweight enough for my toddler to carry around on their own. The buttons are colorful, engaging, and easy to press, and the sounds/music are upbeat without being too loud or annoying for parents. I love that it introduces letters, numbers, and fun phrases in a way that keeps my child entertained while learning. It feels sturdy and well-made, which is a huge plus since toddlers can be a little rough with their toys. Overall, it’s the perfect mix of playful and educational—my toddler feels like they have their own “real” laptop, and I feel great knowing they’re learning while playing. Highly recommend for any parent looking for an engaging educational toy!",5,2025-09-24,positive
2243,B06XL1B7QN,"My favorite kids toy by far!.This little laptop is a life saver! My son is obsessed with my laptop but since Ive gotten this one he does not touch mine. I can hear him repeat the sounds that scout is making and he is 21 months old with very little words. He stays entertained for a good while. We do not do a lot of TV and i prefer him not to be looking at a phone or iPad or any other electronic, so this feels a little safer, the screen isn't as bright and looks similar to some of the toys we had as kids. It flips around as an ""iPad"" and the screen is actually touch screen so that is pretty cool as well. The size of this is small enough to put in his little bag and he carries it around everywhere. The price on this is incredible and it will probably be my new gifts for all my friends with kids!",5,2025-09-23,positive
2244,B06XL1B7QN,Good product!.Good product!,5,2025-09-22,positive
2245,B06XL1B7QN,"The best toy.Keeps me(28 years old) entertained,imagine a kid.I bought this a long time ago maybe even 2 years.my kid was 2 years old or younger.It's amazing and really cheap for everything it does.So many games and songs and functions.It's so fun and interesting.My kid still plays with it and I do too when I get bored.",5,2025-09-19,positive
2246,B06XL1B7QN,Recommended.Quality great! A great for little ones to learn!,5,2025-09-18,positive
2247,B06XL1B7QN,"Better option than a tablet.The media could not be loaded.I work from home and my toddler was always interested in my laptop, I bought this for her when she was a year and half, and now she’s 3 years and still very interested in it. Its one of her favorite.Its great for learning the alphabets, numbers and not only can you use the keyboard but the screen as well.A much better option than a tablet, good size, nice handle, has songs and sounds, clear big buttons and good value for the money",5,2025-09-17,positive
2248,B06XL1B7QN,OVERALL YES.This product is great especially for the cost. It’s the perfect size for toddler hands and I never originally caught onto how it flips from a computer into a tablet-style mode which was a great surprise .It’s so intricate as far as not repeating the same stuff over and over. This also works well for multiple age groups so it won’t be a toy that gets tossed in a year.  I’d definitely buy again if given the opportunity.,5,2025-09-17,positive
2249,B06XL1B7QN,"My toddlers favorite toy!!.This is my 18month olds FAVORITE toy. She loves pretending to type on it and it has helped her further learn her ABCs and numbers especially with the music feature on the computer. I like how it can both be a tablet and a computer. She prefers the computer because she likes the keyboard but I can see as she gets older wanting to use the tablet version more. I purchased this truthfully because I work remotely so while mommy works on her computer, she can work on hers. It’s worked great for us and she loves it. She plays with it everyday.",5,2025-09-14,positive
2250,B06XL1B7QN,Good to replace other tablets.Our daughter loves it. It gives her the tablet feel while she learns. Her counting has gotten so much better also. This was a great buy for our family.,5,2025-09-12,positive
