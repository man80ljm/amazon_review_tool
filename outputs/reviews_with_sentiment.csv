The two volume levels are great for different settings, and being able to program up to three names is a fantastic feature.

There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion.

It literally only spells it, it doesn’t even SAY it.

625,B06XL1B7QN,"Fun little learning laptop for kids!.My kid really loves this laptop/tablet toy. The screen gets pretty bright, so it's best not to use it in the dark for too long, but it also means that it can be used while it's bright outside and they can still see it fine. The screen is decently sized, it's fine for what it's trying to teach kids, and it's pixelated screen graphics also have a good refresh rate. It's nice that it will say the letters when pressed, and in one of the modes it will also show an animal on screen, say what kind of animal it is, and play a sound. This is good for learning the letters and about learning different animals. The touchscreen aspect isn't used a lot, but for the couple games it has where you're meant to interact with something on the screen it's used well. There's some more ""advanced"" learning too, like where it asks to find a specific letter which is also nice to see. We like that it has 2 volume modes, however do note that it does not have a mute mode. I think the learning content on this is nice, and it's a good way to introduce younger kids to the alphabet in an engaging way.",5,2025-11-27,"Fun little learning laptop for kids!.My kid really loves this laptop/tablet toy.

The size is perfect for small hands, and it’s lightweight enough for my toddler to carry around on their own. The buttons are colorful, engaging, and easy to press, and the sounds/music are upbeat without being too loud or annoying for parents. I love that it introduces letters, numbers, and fun phrases in a way that keeps my child entertained while learning. It feels sturdy and well-made, which is a huge plus since toddlers can be a little rough with their toys.

I can hear him repeat the sounds that scout is making and he is 21 months old with very little words. He stays entertained for a good while. We do not do a lot of TV and i prefer him not to be looking at a phone or iPad or any other electronic, so this feels a little safer, the screen isn't as bright and looks similar to some of the toys we had as kids. It flips around as an ""iPad"" and the screen is actually touch screen so that is pretty cool as well. The size of this is small enough to put in his little bag and he carries it around everywhere.

767,B09MW38Z5F,Great for preschoolers.This leap frog prep for preschool activity book comes with six different pages that are interactive. Some of the pages you write on with a dry erase marker and some of it you touch with your fingers. There are three modes-one is explore mode one is learn mode and the other is play mode.  You can use all those modes on each of the six pages. I really like that there are two different volume buttons so one is a little softer than the other. The dry erase marker that comes with this activity book is not my favorite. Once you write on the book it is very hard to get it off even right away. I wish they could have included a dry erase marker that you could erase right away or didn’t take a lot of water to rub off the ink. I tried two different other dry erase markers (from two different brands) on this book and I was able to wipe it off right away.

I don’t like that he’s choosing the right letter and being told he got it wrong, it doesn’t seem like that’s going to help him learn.And I wish the phone part came away from the backboard like the letter writing part does.

1251,B01FVS6V9Y,"Solid buy..We got one of these about 4 years ago for our son and we have given it as a gift about four times now.It makes a great gift, and for a later birthday or Christmas you can add to the gift by getting the larger deck of cards for it.The durability it great!! We have ours set up on the back of our couch and three of my boys use it to climb on and jump off of when playing on the couch and let me tell you this thing is a survivor! My boys did crack the front of the desk and it still works! However! I dislike how the legs come off so easily. Any time it’s move or picked up the legs come off. The stools legs stay in much better then the desk.The buttons are sensitive to touch like some people say but we don’t mind that because our one year gets to play with it and it’s easy for him to use it as well. All my kids have been able to play with it at a young age because of this.  So that’s a plus for me!My biggest complaint about the desk is that when buying the larger set of cards, you have to have the little chip cards for the desk card to work. If you don’t have the chip card, like you lose it (it’s like a cassette tape), the the cards you insert won’t work. So you’d have to buy the whole card set again.As far as packaging goes, the last time we ordered I ordered frustration free and it came in a plain brown cardboard box that had the title of the desk on it. Normally I wouldn’t care at all but we bought it as a birthday gift so the packaging made it not so appealing. But!

For this reason, I ended up returning it.During the setup, I decided to try the “90-day trial” for more apps as there isn't much offered without the additional subscription. Unfortunately, it was late at night and I mistakenly made an error while entering my email. After returning from my trip the subscription was supposedly cancelled, and the tablet was restored to the factory and returned. To my surprise, months later I’m still getting charged!?I reached out to Leapfrog customer service and no one could help due to the wrong email! I have provided the order #, phone number, the tablet’s serial #, card number that was being charged and still “they can't find any account with that information”. After multiple attempts at solving the issue with Leapfrog, I decided to go through my bank to dispute the charges. They kept $30 for the first charge, at this point I have up.

My last child now a toddler was not going to be an exception and we looked forward to giving her the latest version of what LeapFrog had to offer ,the LeapPad Academy Tablet. We got her this for Christmas and I was reallly excited to see what she would be able to make of it as my first two kids , now teens really benefitted from using this in their formative years. Truth be told they had Leapster Explorers and one lasted up till the arrival of the LeapPad.So where is the disappointment you may ask. Well from day one we noticed that the screen proved a bit unreactive at times but we simply put it down to software challenges that work out over time. But naively we were wrong , the problem grew progressively worse to the point where the frustration made my daughter abandon the device. The simplest of strokes wouldn't elicit a response on the screen . Also frustrating has been the WiFi connectivity , its been very inconsistent and drops linkage to the LeapPad academy midgame on a regular basis. In short this turned out to be a nightmare scenario for a bitSome respite came when we switched to run the Leappad Academy from the computer and laptops for her to play the games. She is now rebuilding some desire to play the games as she progresses in a consistent manner using the mouse. She really enjoys the LeapPad Academy and this (initially 3 month free) paid platform  has proven to be  the saving grace. It hasn't assuaged my personal frustration as the whole point of creting an avenue for learning has been disrupted significantly . Which now means I have to acquire a standalone tablet to recreate the experience , or seek out an alternative which defeats the purposeThe two stars are for the software otherwise it would have been much worse.",2,2020-03-31,"Shockingly  Disappointing.I've been an advocate for LeapFrog products for well over a decade to friends and family.

It's durable and the bumpers are great for how rough he gets with his toys sometimes. And it is great for him and I to do activities together. My biggest and really only complaint is that the load time to turn on and get to the games is ridiculous and it DOES NOT HOLD A CHARGE for the life of it. He could play with it for 30 minutes and it's already at a low battery. Does not help for long car rides.I also wish he could play games on it without us having to pay for a yearly subscription.

1558,B07PLG93NS,"It'll do.I bought this as a gift for my son's fourth birthday. I had driven myself almost crazy reading reviews and trying to decide on the best tablet for him, then finally decided on this one. I ordered a couple months ahead of time, which turned out to be an excellent idea. The first time I ordered this, the item I received had clearly already been opened and returned. The box was dented, retaped in places, and the tablet inside had been put back in upside down. The return process through Amazon was fast, thankfully, and I got the replacement within a few days.Having read other reviews, I made sure to open the tablet and have it all registered and set up before wrapping it for my son's birthday. I also hijacked it and added the Amazon app store using fairly easy instructions I found online, then added some other apps I'd read about and researched. I made sure to download everything I could, since one of the main reasons to buy a tablet like this was for entertainment in the car during an upcoming road trip. It worked great for that, and we took an extra long charger cord for use in the car as well.As to the actual quality of the tablet.... I'd say it's a good starter tablet if your child has never used another tablet before. If your child is used to the speed of a fire or ipad, they'll get frustrated with this one. I get frustrated myself with the length of time it takes to do basic things (ie: turning on). The touchscreen is also not that sensitive, and I find myself having to tap repeatedly to get a simple function to work. I originally set up the time limits to be very conservative but after about a month, maybe 6 weeks, I found myself turning them off completely. My son never met the time limits, much less exceeded them, and having them set was getting irritating. I think the timer count starts as soon as the tablet is woken up for the day? Which is ridiculous. My son would play with it for ten minutes, then come back a few hours later and it would tell him he'd exceeded his time. Which is why we found ourselves constantly overriding it and eventually turned off the limits completely. I did keep the parental controls as far as internet access and the app store because dude will definitely buy himself ALL the Lego apps if he could. Which are ridiculously overpriced, as are all Legos, but that's neither here nor there for this review.The leapfrog app options are ridiculous and I honestly thought there would be more free or cheap ones but there aren't. And my son isn't into any of the characters that seem to be popular on the Leapfrog app store. Which is why I basically rooted the durn thing.The price of this tablet is pretty high compared to what you get (slow speeds, price gouging on apps, etc) and compared to similar tablets elsewhere (my husband bought a renewed fire tablet for $60 that works amazingly great and might be the next tablet we get our son).",3,2022-11-11,"It'll do.I bought this as a gift for my son's fourth birthday.

1591,B07PLG93NS,"Kids-ready tablet, but expensive & outdated.I was very excited about this LeapFrog LeapPad tablet for our son to play with. And he does enjoy playing with it. However, for $160 I would only recommend this to someone with no technology inclination whatsoever who wants a ready to go technology toy.Here's why: LeapPad is very easy to set up, comes preloaded with a handful of games and is generally ""kid proof"" right out of the box.Unfortunately, that's where positives end. The 7"" screen is of such poor quality that you have to be looking at it perfectly straight on to avoid distortion. Oh and it's worse in portrait mode than landscape and also worse at higher brightness. The device also runs on top of a very old ""neutered"" version of Android 4.4. It came out ~6 years ago and Google stopped releasing updates for it (including key *security* updates) almost 5 years ago. Given that this device relies on WiFi connectivity and will likely travel with the child to various WiFi networks (e.g. restaurants, hotels, airports, etc) this device has decent potential to get infected with something nasty and then spread it to other systems. I work in IT Security and a device running Android 4.4 would never be allowed on a corporate network these days.LeapPad does have a web browser and a couple of other regular tablet features in ""parent"" mode. They are pretty mediocre by today's standards. It also does include a handful of games and they're quite fun but it's pretty clear from using the device that it's really not going to entertain kids for very long and they're really trying to get you to sign up for LeapPad academy ($9.99/mth or a bit less for a yearly subscription).Now, say you accept this cost as the games are quite good. In that case, LeapFrog academy supports a multitude of devices, including Amazon Fire tablets. You can get a new Amazon Fire 7 tablet with a much better screen, dimensions and running a much newer version of Android (7.1 I believe) for $69.99. That $100 you're saving can buy you a super sturdy case for it and almost cover a year of LeapPad academy! And no offense to LeapFrog, but I have a lot of faith in Amazon's application & device security practices. It's going to be much better at being a tablet than LeapPad in every way but is still not running a full version of Android. You can get that full version of Android in a Samsung Galaxy Tab E lite or in a clearance model of a Samsung Galaxy tablet, likely running Android 8 or newer for around $140 - still cheaper than LeapPad. Want to spend even less? Take a look at some well rated ""no name"" tablets - they can be quite decent.You would then have to set up parental controls on either Amazon Fire or another tablet to make it kid-safe. This is relatively easy to do by following online tutorials but I recognize that this still may be an issue for folks and thus would be the main situation where LeapPad comes out on top.As for me, even though we have this LeapPad already, I don't want it on my Wi-Fi network. I've put it on my guest network for now but we'll likely go down the Amazon Fire 7 route in the future.

I DO like that you can use the academy game on your cell phone as well as the device and it syncs your progress.I really dislike that it requires sooooo much money to get a good group of games. The description of the games on the web page are terrible and there are no refunds if you download a game you don't like.I wanted to give 3 stars because the device is cheap, I got over 200$ invested in just games and then it stops working... exhausting and disappointing.I gave it 4 stars because the kids really love it and DO get a lot out of it.

1633,B07PLG93NS,"Best Learning Tablet Ever!.This is one of my favorite educational toys ever. We've owned LeapPads in the past, but this thing is on a whole new level. The apps that come with it are great, but my preschooler really loves the Academy app. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that LeapFrog gave us a free 3 month trial of their Academy app with the tablet, but my little one loved it so much that I went ahead and subscribed to it for a year. (the yearly price is VERY reasonable; especially if you homeschool like us and are used to buying extremely expensive curriculum) While set-up was super easy, I skipped a few steps and could not figure out how to get back to where I accessed my 3 free months of the Academy app. I contacted CS and they replied with very detailed instructions of how to get back to the step I missed. While waiting for them to reply, I grew impatient with my kids begging to use the new LeapPad that I just did a factory reset and started over again. Took me just a few minutes to set it up and the kids even less time to figure out how to work the tablet. It seems to be very durable and I love that the stylus pen stores in the protective bumper. I wish I had 3 of these because my kids (ages 4, 6, and 8) constantly fight over this thing! They all think they're so grown up using it because it's a legit Android-based tablet and does not look like a cheap, bulky, plastic encased toy. I use it as a bargaining tool; finish your lessons and chores and you get to play on the LeapPad first. :-) Other homeschooling parents ask us all the time what curriculum they should buy for their preschoolers. I always, always, always tell them to skip the expensive curriculum when the kids are that little and get them a LeapPad or other LeapFrog toys to let them play while they learn and inspire future school success. This thing is more than perfect for that. I am removing 1 star because the shatter-safe screen is hard to view from certain angles. You need to have it positioned just right to focus on what you're viewing. This is a problem when multiple kids are trying to view the screen at the same time. Also, something is up with the camera app. No matter how we rotate the screen, the image is captured upside down. I'm sure it's an easy fix from the app developers, but it's super frustrating for my little ones who love to walk around taking pics of literally everything. Lastly, the headphone jack will not work with my little one's safe volume headphones, but it will work with my ear buds. It can get kind of annoying for us parents who have to listen to every little sound that's coming out of the tablet when the kids are playing. Overall, we all love the LeapPad Academy learning tablet and highly recommend it for educational play for all kids from about 3 to 8 years old.

I also noticed it’s a little slow at times depending on what you’re doing, not all the time but with bigger webpages.It’s not bad for the price, but if you’re looking for a tablet with more of a “AppStore” and more mainstream functions then I suggest buying an iPad.Leapfrog games are super educational and even tho it’s not a highend tablet my sons still able to have fun and watch YouTube videos (which was the initial reason for buying)The case comes off for easy cleaning which has a sturdy stand, the speakers are loud & it also has a 3.5mm Jack for headphones.Overall it’s not bad, but it’s not great.

1651,B07PLG93NS,"Good learning tablet to start at early age.My 5 year old was using iPad for various learning games and videos, but he recently broke iPad. This time I did not want to give him expensive thing like iPad and LeapFrog leapPad perfectly fits the bill.It is not that expensive and made very sturdy. Tablet is covered in rubber guard case and feels well designed and sturdy. It comes with nice stylus and kick stand to keep tablet on desk. We were impressed as soon as we opened the box we were impressed with high quality hardware. However as soon as we turned the tablet ON, we were little disappointed. Screen is not as high quality as iPad and viewing angle is very poor. You need to be perfectly viewing straight. The display seems mediocre which is expected at this price point. I am not sure if LeapFrog made it in this way to protect kids eyes. My son did not mind it and did not notice much difference.With excitement, my son started exploring included games and application and in fe days, he got bored with it. Most applications are below his age and does not interest him very long. He wanted his iPad back because it was loaded with lots of learning and fun applications. You can download and buy new applications from Leapfrog store, but they seemed quite expensive. To keep interest going, I signed up for 3 months free trial for LeapFrog Academy and honestly it his hard to keep his interest going on with it. There are few reasons behind it: (1) For kids who cannot read yet, it’s not intuitive to scan through all the contents and try it out. So he needs parent support. (2) Content is not very polished yet. For example, reading the book. when you ask to read to kids, it is way too fast. (3) His familiarity with iPad and Apple Ecosystem may be pushing him back because he is not familiar with Android system.I will keep involved with him to get his interest going and see how it goes. It should be mentioned that LeaFrog Academy costs $7.99/month and can be used on any device.Overall, I thing this is great started tablet and still think that if I had a choice earlier I would have started with this rather than iPad since it is meant for kids and slowly transition him to expensive options such as iPad when he grows up.Overall, I think it is good learning tablet to start at early age.",4,2019-09-29,"Good learning tablet to start at early age.My 5 year old was using iPad for various learning games and videos, but he recently broke iPad.

1654,B07PLG93NS,"Perfect For Preschoolers, Pricey App Store.For its price point, this is a pretty good tablet. It comes with all you need to get started, including protective bumpers and a stylus. I call them bumpers because it is definitely not a case. I haven’t tried throwing it down the stairs but I don’t think that I can trust this silicone case for rough play. The tablet slides out of the case quite easily. There is a stand on the back of the case. The stylus is attached by a short cord and slides into the side of the tablet for storage. The usb port, micro SD slot, headphone jack, power and volume buttons are all located on the top of the tablet and not covered by the case. I don’t think it’s a great idea to make the micro SD slot that easily accessible to kids, I would have hidden it in a different place.The tablet works right out of the box. It is preloaded with some apps and others can be added. I’m pretty tech savvy and I still had to play around with this tablet to really understand how to get it going. I had to sign into my leapfrog account (or sign up for one if you don’t have one) and then set the limitations for the children using the tablet. You can set up a profile for multiple children and monitor pretty much everything from screen time to what they’re looking at.My children have specific apps that they love. Netflix, youtubekids, and roblox are the most important ones. Roblox can be downloaded through the amazon app store, but netflix has to be done differently. I still cannot get youtube kids on the tablet. The amazon app store is accessible through the parent portal of the tablet. The instructions that come with the leappad are very vague and I found myself online looking for videos on how to access and download different apps. Keep in mind though, that the leapfrog approved babysitting service isn’t available for the netflix app if you should download it. Your child will have access to everything.I think the leapfrog app store is expensive, more so than others. You get a three month subscription to the leapfrog academy included with the purchase of this tablet and after that it costs eight dollars a month. It’s basically a subscription to ongoing age appropriate school lessons. If you choose not to continue with your subscription, you can still access other apps on the tablet. So no, it doesn’t render the tablet useless.The home screen is pretty interactive, and it is really easy to navigate. There is also a voice that explains things as you go. There is a camera on the front and back of the unit, pictures are good quality. The screen is okay, it’s said to be shatter resistant. You have to look at it straight on, or you can’t see what’s on it very well. It makes sharing difficult.The recommended age for this tablet is three to eight. I think its definitely more suitable for preschool and not for older kids. My older kids were over it very quickly and didn’t have much interest in the baby apps it came with (their words, not mine). The leapfrog approved content is good, but very basic so more geared towards younger. My younger kids were happy with exploring this and find it easy to play, they used the stylus a lot.Overall, I think this is a good tablet if you have a younger child and are on a budget. My children have been using ipads from the get-go and I can set a lot of the same restrictions on those with more options as far as apps go. I find the leappad extremely limited.

1732,B07PLG93NS,"4.5 stars.I like this tablet for my almost 3 year old. He had a Kindle tablet that a friend got him (against my wishes lol) and I really dislike that tablet. He gets really crazy when I take the Kindle away and somehow he gets on YouTube and finds Cartoon Network Adult Swim or other weird videos. With the Leappad, he can't do that. There are some videos from some of the apps I downloaded, but most are educational. I would take away a star because the apps are kind of expensive and Leappad Academy isn't cheap either. I'm not saying it's too expensive and that it's not worth it, it is worth it, but the apps should be more affordable for people who buy the tablet. Especially individual apps. I was honestly pretty surprised at how much I had to spend for just a handful of apps. Despite this, my loathing towards the Kindle tablet prevents me from taking a star away lol. Also, I've noticed that my son isn't crazy attached to the Leappad like he is with the Kindle. I let him play with the Leappad when he wants throughout the day, and he doesn't sit on it all day. He also doesn't freak out if I take it from him to do something else. He totally melts down if I take the Kindle from him. To me, that's another big plus in favor of the Leappad.

There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion.

2205,B06XL1B7QN,"Fun little learning laptop for kids!.My kid really loves this laptop/tablet toy. The screen gets pretty bright, so it's best not to use it in the dark for too long, but it also means that it can be used while it's bright outside and they can still see it fine. The screen is decently sized, it's fine for what it's trying to teach kids, and it's pixelated screen graphics also have a good refresh rate. It's nice that it will say the letters when pressed, and in one of the modes it will also show an animal on screen, say what kind of animal it is, and play a sound. This is good for learning the letters and about learning different animals. The touchscreen aspect isn't used a lot, but for the couple games it has where you're meant to interact with something on the screen it's used well. There's some more ""advanced"" learning too, like where it asks to find a specific letter which is also nice to see. We like that it has 2 volume modes, however do note that it does not have a mute mode.

2242,B06XL1B7QN,"Engaging for a busy two year old! 10/10 recommend.This toddler learning laptop / tablet has been such a fun and educational toy for my 2 year old! The size is perfect for small hands, and it’s lightweight enough for my toddler to carry around on their own. The buttons are colorful, engaging, and easy to press, and the sounds/music are upbeat without being too loud or annoying for parents. I love that it introduces letters, numbers, and fun phrases in a way that keeps my child entertained while learning. It feels sturdy and well-made, which is a huge plus since toddlers can be a little rough with their toys. Overall, it’s the perfect mix of playful and educational—my toddler feels like they have their own “real” laptop, and I feel great knowing they’re learning while playing.

2243,B06XL1B7QN,"My favorite kids toy by far!.This little laptop is a life saver! My son is obsessed with my laptop but since Ive gotten this one he does not touch mine. I can hear him repeat the sounds that scout is making and he is 21 months old with very little words. He stays entertained for a good while. We do not do a lot of TV and i prefer him not to be looking at a phone or iPad or any other electronic, so this feels a little safer, the screen isn't as bright and looks similar to some of the toys we had as kids. It flips around as an ""iPad"" and the screen is actually touch screen so that is pretty cool as well. The size of this is small enough to put in his little bag and he carries it around everywhere. The price on this is incredible and it will probably be my new gifts for all my friends with kids!",5,2025-09-23,"My favorite kids toy by far!.This little laptop is a life saver!

2248,B06XL1B7QN,OVERALL YES.This product is great especially for the cost. It’s the perfect size for toddler hands and I never originally caught onto how it flips from a computer into a tablet-style mode which was a great surprise .It’s so intricate as far as not repeating the same stuff over and over. This also works well for multiple age groups so it won’t be a toy that gets tossed in a year.  I’d definitely buy again if given the opportunity.,5,2025-09-17,OVERALL YES.This product is great especially for the cost.
