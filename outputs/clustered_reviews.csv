318,B06XL1B7QN,PARENTS BE AWARE OF MUSIC MODE.I have to write this review on my laptop however I am warning all parents of the music mode touch screen. As parents know children soak things up as a sponge soaks up water. They have big imaginations and tend to emulate what they see. I am big on a child remaining as a child and not being a raunchy adult. There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion. Yes its a great tool to help them learn but be vigilant because if not monitored could easily introduce vulgar and inapropriate movements in your child. Not surprising considering Netflix and cuties and now people trying to force children to make adult decisions at school.....

For this reason, I ended up returning it.During the setup, I decided to try the “90-day trial” for more apps as there isn't much offered without the additional subscription. Unfortunately, it was late at night and I mistakenly made an error while entering my email. After returning from my trip the subscription was supposedly cancelled, and the tablet was restored to the factory and returned. To my surprise, months later I’m still getting charged!?I reached out to Leapfrog customer service and no one could help due to the wrong email! I have provided the order #, phone number, the tablet’s serial #, card number that was being charged and still “they can't find any account with that information”. After multiple attempts at solving the issue with Leapfrog, I decided to go through my bank to dispute the charges. They kept $30 for the first charge, at this point I have up.

1591,B07PLG93NS,"Kids-ready tablet, but expensive & outdated.I was very excited about this LeapFrog LeapPad tablet for our son to play with. And he does enjoy playing with it. However, for $160 I would only recommend this to someone with no technology inclination whatsoever who wants a ready to go technology toy.Here's why: LeapPad is very easy to set up, comes preloaded with a handful of games and is generally ""kid proof"" right out of the box.Unfortunately, that's where positives end. The 7"" screen is of such poor quality that you have to be looking at it perfectly straight on to avoid distortion. Oh and it's worse in portrait mode than landscape and also worse at higher brightness. The device also runs on top of a very old ""neutered"" version of Android 4.4. It came out ~6 years ago and Google stopped releasing updates for it (including key *security* updates) almost 5 years ago. Given that this device relies on WiFi connectivity and will likely travel with the child to various WiFi networks (e.g. restaurants, hotels, airports, etc) this device has decent potential to get infected with something nasty and then spread it to other systems. I work in IT Security and a device running Android 4.4 would never be allowed on a corporate network these days.LeapPad does have a web browser and a couple of other regular tablet features in ""parent"" mode. They are pretty mediocre by today's standards. It also does include a handful of games and they're quite fun but it's pretty clear from using the device that it's really not going to entertain kids for very long and they're really trying to get you to sign up for LeapPad academy ($9.99/mth or a bit less for a yearly subscription).Now, say you accept this cost as the games are quite good. In that case, LeapFrog academy supports a multitude of devices, including Amazon Fire tablets. You can get a new Amazon Fire 7 tablet with a much better screen, dimensions and running a much newer version of Android (7.1 I believe) for $69.99. That $100 you're saving can buy you a super sturdy case for it and almost cover a year of LeapPad academy! And no offense to LeapFrog, but I have a lot of faith in Amazon's application & device security practices. It's going to be much better at being a tablet than LeapPad in every way but is still not running a full version of Android. You can get that full version of Android in a Samsung Galaxy Tab E lite or in a clearance model of a Samsung Galaxy tablet, likely running Android 8 or newer for around $140 - still cheaper than LeapPad. Want to spend even less? Take a look at some well rated ""no name"" tablets - they can be quite decent.You would then have to set up parental controls on either Amazon Fire or another tablet to make it kid-safe. This is relatively easy to do by following online tutorials but I recognize that this still may be an issue for folks and thus would be the main situation where LeapPad comes out on top.As for me, even though we have this LeapPad already, I don't want it on my Wi-Fi network. I've put it on my guest network for now but we'll likely go down the Amazon Fire 7 route in the future. And I'm thinking that LeapFrog Academy subscription will be worth the money in a few months to get our son to interact with (and learn from) some very well-made educational games!",3,2019-08-31,"Kids-ready tablet, but expensive & outdated.I was very excited about this LeapFrog LeapPad tablet for our son to play with.
