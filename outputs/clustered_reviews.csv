1,B0BRXPG99Q,Screen doesn’t work and won’t calibrate..Screen is too dark and won’t calibrate so we can’t even use the pencil portion of the toy and of course you don’t know that until you open the toy all the way up. Do not recommend.,1,2026-01-1,negative,2
2,B0BRXPG99Q,"The screen stopped working after a month.Super sad because my daughter received this as a birthday gift and within a month the screen stopped working and is super dim and barely visible. Worked great for a month and she loved it, so bummed it broke so quickly.",1,2025-12-13,negative,2

18,B0BRXPG99Q,"you can't hear the volume as you should,.I purchased this for my granddaughter and the volume is very hard to hear. I got this for my daughter when she was a child and love all the  Leaf Frog products and couldn't wait to get her this as well. I got it and I'm very disappointed with the product, volume on high you still could not hear it to play with it and enjoy it. I would really appreciate it if someone could contact me.DisappointmentLisa",1,2023-12-29,negative,6

21,B0BRXPG99Q,No backlight.Backlight doesn’t work. Leapfrog tried to convince me there is no backlight for this product when all product images show a backlight and the front of the box highlights it as a feature.,2,2025-12-24,negative,10
22,B0BRXPG99Q,"Broken screen.Half the screen flickers like it’s been damaged. No outter package was shipped with the product, just the box itself, so I don’t know if that caused initial damage to the screen. It seems like a screen defect is common with this product though.",2,2025-05-16,negative,2
23,B0BRXPG99Q,Eh.Doesn’t let you program name easily,2,2025-04-29,negative,7
24,B0BRXPG99Q,"This COULD be great…..But it only allows you to do an activity three times before forcing you to select another activity again. So, if your child is on the letter writing activity, they can write three letters and that’s it and then it tells them to select another activity. You can select the same activity again, but you can’t just continue on without restating the activity. Why in the world would it do this? It prevents kids from being able to focus for more than 1-2 minutes at a time. My child immediately hated this after it made her pick an activity when she was focused and happily writing letters. Now she doesn’t use it.",2,2025-02-14,negative,4
25,B0BRXPG99Q,"Product Letters and black spots.We received the leapfrog device yesterday and I'm not understanding what's going on with the letters. It appears there are black spots or the paint is chipping. The device itself is working fine, however when the letters disappear it will be no use for learning. I've ordered 3 of these for my grandchildren ages 4 to 6, and to are artistic. We need the letters to stay visible. Thinking of cancelling pending shipping orders of the other 2 devices.",2,2024-11-19,negative,10
26,B0BRXPG99Q,"Touch screen does not work.Very cute learning toy. However the touch screen does not work, this ruined the appeal completely.",2,2024-11-17,negative,1
27,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great concept.I think it’s an effective way of learning, but I would feel better about it if the buttons on the lower right actually worked so my 4year old can do the activities.",2,2023-08-18,negative,4
29,B0BRXPG99Q,No me gustó.No era lo que yo esperaba,3,2025-08-30,negative,3

32,B0BRXPG99Q,Leapfrog review.I love that my child is learning to write his letters and numbers. He loves to learn new words. But I've only had it for 4 months and the screen is significantly scratched up and I know he is only using the pencil...,3,2025-04-30,negative,10
35,B0BRXPG99Q,Fun but not Durable.My 4 year old received this for Christmas. I love the way it works and how it teacher. But it’s a kids toy which means it gets dropped more than a normal item. We’ve only had it 3 weeks & part of the screen already is not working. So my son is getting frustrated he can’t use the toy properly :(,3,2025-01-9,negative,4
36,B0BRXPG99Q,"Empaque deteriorado.Le doy 3 estrellas porque el empaque vino en muy malas condiciones y dicho sea de paso lo compré para un regalo.Aún dañada la caja, el articulonse encuentra en muy buen estado. No  se afectó, así que lo reempacaré para el regalo.Tiene buen peso,  buen tamaño y buen sonido.",3,2024-12-10,negative,3
38,B0BRXPG99Q,"The pen is thick.The pen is too thick.  I didn't consider  the small hand that would be using it, when I purchased it. not something he picks when it's time to work on alphabet.  He's 3yrs old.",3,2024-05-19,negative,5
41,B0BRXPG99Q,Much smaller in person.Very small,3,2024-01-20,negative,4
42,B0BRXPG99Q,Can’t Add Every Name.The toy is fun and educational but one major complaint for us. My kiddos name contains three letters in succession that also spell a “bad word.” The tablet won’t allow you to type those letters even in the context of another word. This results in the name function not working because we aren’t able to enter the spelling of his name due to those three letters being in the middle of the name. I understand having a “filter” option to not enter certain words but not letting you type anything that even contains those letters is frustrating.,3,2023-12-26,negative,1
43,B0BRXPG99Q,まぁまぁ.うちの5歳と3歳がたまに遊びます。持ち運びには良いと思います。,3,2024-12-6,negative,0
45,B0BRXPG99Q,Great toy for a five year old..My five year old LOVED THIS.The only issue is that the sound got significantly lower after a few days of playing with it even after changing the batteries.  I don’t mind the lower sound but found it strange this would happen.,4,2026-01-2,negative,4
50,B0BRXPG99Q,"Great for fun. Don’t bank on it for teaching kids how to write properly.My toddler loves it. Saved us a lot of frustration on long drives. It also helped her get used to the letter shapes. She has hours of fun writing on it.It won’t teach them pencil grip and control though. I wouldn’t suggest this if you want to buy it for teaching kids how to write. This is like any other learning tablet, they can learn their letters and have fun with some drawing, but this should not be the primary tool teaching them how to write.",4,2025-06-26,negative,7
51,B0BRXPG99Q,Great toy / learning tool.Kept my 5 yo occupied for a 2.5 hour car ride but is so annoying to hear as a parent in the drivers seat - especially when you realize you’re singing the songs to yourself at work the next week,4,2025-06-23,negative,4
60,B0BRXPG99Q,Pretty sturdy.Looks very nice but probably for a 4 year old. My 3 year old got bored of it very quickly. Good sound quality,4,2024-09-28,negative,4
61,B0BRXPG99Q,"School Prep Must.My 5 yo grandson had no interest in ""learning"" over the summer.  Concerned he might have a learning disability, I ordered this for him.  Mr. Pencil quickly reinforced what he learned in Pre-school.  He still grabs it after school to practice.  Not every day, but often enough that it wasn't a waste of money.",4,2024-08-24,negative,4
63,B0BRXPG99Q,"As advertised!.My kiddo didn’t love this, she just turned 4 and already has a basis on letters so I think it would be great for a kid just starting out.",4,2024-04-15,negative,4
64,B0BRXPG99Q,Practice.This is a nice tablet my 4 year old likes it but it has too many options and is distracting it would be nice if it only focused on letter and name writing.,4,2024-04-6,negative,1
72,B0BRXPG99Q,"Disappointed.The media could not be loaded.I’ve bought two for my girls and unfortunately this is how the buttons look after ONE DAY of using them a few minutes. For what I can see the white part inside this buttons crack every time you push them so I expect the letters and numbers to be gone by a month or less, is the cheapest quality for a such a good toy. I wanted to contact de seller but I couldn’t find any option, if the seller wants to contact me and work it out I would be willing to change my mind otherwise I’m definitely returning it.Update: I did return both and received a replacement with a better quality but still not the best quality. Still appreciate the costumer service response.",4,2025-04-10,negative,8

110,B0BRXPG99Q,"May be useful.The media could not be loaded.Screen isn’t very bright, the quality of it is average, my daughter thinks it’s kinda fun, it functional with alphabet and numerical learning and you can get it at an affordable price.",5,2025-12-13,negative,1
166,B0BRXPG99Q,"El mejor regalo que pude comprar para mi hijo.MR. Pecil es muy bueno, me gusta mucho y a mi pequeño hijo de 4 años también le gusta, pasa mucho tiempo jugando con el, me gusta porque es un juguete pero esta aprendiendo con el, me hubiera gustado que estuviera en español e ingles pero solo esta en ingles.

187,B06XL1B7QN,Keyboard broke under a month.Do not buy this garbage. Took a few weeks for the keyboard to completely disconnect and stop working. I googled this issue and tons of similar reports came up and repair guides as it’s so common. DO NOT BUY,1,2025-10-22,negative,8

193,B06XL1B7QN,Does not work !.This item arrived in a torn and open display box and does not work at all ! Very disappointed as it was a gift ! It looks like it was a returned item and probably for the same reason  . . . . . DOES NOT WORK  !!,1,2025-09-1,negative,9

196,B06XL1B7QN,"One doesn't work.The media could not be loaded.I ordered 2 because they had decent reviews. I have twin nieces , but As soon as they came in I turned one on and as you can see in the video the only button that works is R. When you close the lid to the laptop mode the touchscreen works. But when I first turned it on, the dog on the screen doesn't finish saying his name either. It doesn't appear to have any cracks or scratches on it but I never removed it from the box. I hope before I receive another one, that maybe the seller can try it and make sure it works before they ship.",1,2025-07-18,negative,1
197,B06XL1B7QN,"Doesn’t Work.This didn’t work right out of the box for me.  Batteries were included, which was nice. Turned it on and it prompted me to push letter keys and number keys for the games/activities, but when I pushed them it didn’t work. Tried to turn it to “tablet” mode - that also didn’t work. I changed the batteries, thinking it was worth a try, but no improvement. Don’t know if I’ll take the time to return it but definitely won’t purchase again.",1,2025-07-1,negative,8
198,B06XL1B7QN,Product good delivery sucked !!.While I’m happy to get my package and I should have taken a picture because where the driver took a picture of the package is not actually where they left it. They left it in my rain soaked yard that was flooding because of the storms we are having! It’s late so I almost missed seeing that it had been delivered! I am sure if i hadn’t seen it when I did it would have been ruined!!With that being said I love it got it for my grand daughter’s birthday and I’m sure she will love it!!,1,2025-05-27,negative,0
199,B06XL1B7QN,"Go to the store instead is not worth it.So one screen you can not see anything only hear the sounds no letters, no animals nothing pops up.

202,B06XL1B7QN,Doesn’t stay as a laptop!.The laptop/tablet is mainly just a tablet. My daughter wants to use it as a laptop majority of the time playing but she can’t cause the screen flips back even with it staying straight up. It doesn’t stay in place.

208,B06XL1B7QN,"Doesn’t work.The media could not be loaded.I purchased this as a Christmas gift at the end of September. When you have multiple kids you know the struggle  of buying everything at once so I start a few months out. Anyway, bought this and it sat in the box until Christmas morning. We opened it and little one was excited to play with it but the top left corner of screen doesn’t work and the screen doesn’t rotate and lock when I laptop mode, making that function useless. Of course, it’s past the return date but it wasn’t opened until Christmas. The leapfrog company said there’s a 90 day warranty but it doesn’t apply because of purchase date. What’s the difference in sitting in my closet and sitting on the shelf? I have photo proof that it was opened on Christmas morning. Anyway- this is the last leapfrog product we will ever purchase.

Halfway through the music section, the dog is dancing, and starts shaking it butt for way too long…. They literally sexualized a dog. Disgusting.

Unfortunately this one worked fine for 1 week then decided to stop working completely. Not a single key works. Worse part is we went on vacation so we were gone when it arrived and we only truly played with it for about 3 days. Have been trying to replace for months and seller/amazon isn’t making it easy.

229,B06XL1B7QN,"Impossible to see, completely useless although nice concept.The screen is completely unviewable, first the screen is very reflective which makes it catch light and have high glare, second the contrast of the screen (black LCD over blue-lit background) is so poor that you cannot see anything anyways beyond some vague shapes, third the viewing angle is non-existent - if you move 1 degree up/left/down/right it also completely removes visibility.  Beyond this, the actual concept is nice with 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, children email writing, and songs, but there's not much here that you wouldn't find in almost any other children's toy (maybe like 30-40 permutations of songs/activities/etc) but since you can't see anything anyways, it's much more frustrating for the child than fun and you'll get alot of anger/crying with it.

I felt confident that everything would work and be fine only to find out this weekend when I gave the present to her that the screen will not stay flipped to the correct side when the toy is open. Very sad to have to take a toy away from a toddler.  I would have thought that these things would be checked out before reselling a used item.

264,B06XL1B7QN,NOT GOOD DESIGN.I am very disappointed in the flip design on the screen. The laptop opening and closing isn’t the issue it’s the screen part that rotates 360 that is not good.

What I notice was the hook where you would lift up the laptop up. I believe that pops off and that’s the problem, I could be wrong all I know it’s very annoying problem.

318,B06XL1B7QN,PARENTS BE AWARE OF MUSIC MODE.I have to write this review on my laptop however I am warning all parents of the music mode touch screen. As parents know children soak things up as a sponge soaks up water. They have big imaginations and tend to emulate what they see. I am big on a child remaining as a child and not being a raunchy adult. There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion. Yes its a great tool to help them learn but be vigilant because if not monitored could easily introduce vulgar and inapropriate movements in your child.

I do have some problems like other buyers which is switching the mode from tablet to laptop... The screen will not fully flat/ fit in.. Another concern is the blue screen it has.

At 4 years old I'm not ready to buy her a laptop or even a chromebook yet. I though this would be a great way to allow her to play pretend while also learning with an interactive toy. The problem is, she had absolutely no interest in it. To be fair, she uses a Kindle Fire and has an old iPhone, which are obviously more advanced than this product. However, I thought the laptop style of it would at least pique and keep some of her interest. She literally played with it for five minutes and told me she didn't want it. Her 5 year old sister has a chromebook so she has no interest in it either. May be good for kids who are not used to modern devices but if your child is accustomed to any type of modern tablet/phone/etc. it is doubtful this product will hold their interest at all. It's difficult to use and a bit outdated.",2,2018-12-5,negative,1

To be fair to the product, I must reveal most of my dissatisfaction is from comparing it to the old version of this toy. I bought the old version used, it came programmed with a name already, no big deal, had the usb to change to my little girls name, or so I thought. I plugged it into my computer and the software for this product, conveniently had been discountined. I was a little frustrated with that fact, but I saw they had made a new version and I was more than happy to spend any amount of money on it. My little girl loved the old version of this toy and I LOVED the personalization, it said your child’s name so many times, it even had emails that you could have personalized with your child’s name and 3 family members! It also had a song of your child’s name. Similar to the violet plush toy, but even more personalized. Now comes this piece of crap, you program your child’s name into it alright, once, you program it into the first letter of their name, when they press it it’ll say “that’s the first letter of your name” and spells it. It literally only spells it, it doesn’t even SAY it. Shame on you leapfrog, as a parent with a child with autism, who is constantly looking for ways to teach her to say her name, the old software/toy was going to be perfect. This “personalization” on this new toy is cheap and lazy and ridiclous.",2,2018-11-18,negative,10

427,B06XL1B7QN,"Lots of options.For the money, there are lots of options. The touch screen works, but the images are hard to see and interpret for little babies. One game makes them select a hair brush? How many babies can interpret this blurry image as a hair brush?The other negative is I wish I had hit all the letter buttons before the return window ended. My I, J and K buttons all say I. Oops.But again, for $18 to distract a baby on a long road trip, it’ll do. I’ll just have to make sure he doesn’t have the game when he really needs to know his letters the RIGHT way.",3,2022-10-7,negative,1
429,B06XL1B7QN,good beginner.This is fun for a 2-3 year old however the screen is a bit dark so it's kind of hard to see Scout the dog. They need to brighten up the graphics. If you are outside or in bright light they wont be able to see the screen.,3,2022-09-16,negative,1
430,B06XL1B7QN,Ehhh.It’s okay for a toddler but honestly the quality of the screen could be ten times better. I am slightly disappointed with this purchase.,3,2022-08-19,negative,1
431,B06XL1B7QN,"For ok life kids who can know their letters.Not many games.  Just push a letter and the laptop says the letter back and screen shows an animal jumping around.  I did feel that much fun would come from this for a younger child who died not even recognize a letter or number.  Would not be able to create a text when not able to identify letters.  Once a child is able to do this i feel it would provide minimal fun.  I was hoping for more interactive games to teach.  Exp:  game shows a letter and encouraged the child to find it, push button, then see the animal jump and hear sounds.  Good level of voice on machine.  Just not interactive or teaching",3,2022-08-17,negative,4
432,B06XL1B7QN,"Good design, poor quality.The design of this one is great, my kid loves it. However, the screen quality is very poor and one spot is not functioning well after a few weeks. That just kills half of the fun since he can’t play the number game now.",3,2022-08-6,negative,1
433,B06XL1B7QN,"Good, but.We like the leapfrog tablet but it appears that there are some slight improvements that could/should be made. the numbers are good until it gets to 10, which is listed as 01.the screen also doesn’t stay in one place in laptop mode, it’d be better if we could get it to not rotate at the slightest change.",3,2022-07-17,negative,10

436,B06XL1B7QN,"So much potential hurt by usability.There are so many great things about this toy, but a few key drawbacks make it almost unusable.1. Contrast is terrible. It’s so difficult to see the images on the screen through the touch sensors. Worse, there’s no obvious use case for the touchscreen which doesn’t even seem to work. So it’s a stupid design since the kid can barely see what’s happening. The LCD lets too much of the blue light through the pixels… like watching a dark movie on a bad LCD TV.2. Volume only has two settings.",3,2022-07-3,negative,1
438,B06XL1B7QN,Ehhh….Nothing spectacular about this product. You can barely see the screen. Graphics are ancient. I’m a 90’s kid and nothing has changed since then.

443,B06XL1B7QN,"No space bar?.My daughter got this for her birthday last year and her and her 3 year old sister love playing with it. I didn't notice it til today, but there's no space bar.

Volume has two settings and no headphone jack. Patience required.",3,2022-01-3,negative,1

466,B06XL1B7QN,It was cute and I liked the learning games.Worked well for awhile. It was bought for a Christmas gift and then all of the sudden stopped working the other day. The batteries were changed and nothing worked other than once when the toddler dropped it on the floor in tablet mode on the rug and it began to light up. Once shut off again nothing worked.

Even when he wasn’t playing with it he would repeat the things he learned from it throughout the day. Unfortunately, it just stopped working without warning less than a month after purchasing it (wasn’t the batteries). Because he loved it so much, he was that much more devastated when it wouldn’t work. It was a amazing toy while it lasted but I’m not sure if I would replace it.

484,B06XL1B7QN,great design quickly outgrown.it works fine teaching abc and 123 it would have been better to do a qwerty keyboard 10/9/7 style goint 10/9/9 having the extra buttons for space and enter instead of having the space bar be enter i guess you can tell your kid has outgrown it when you start getting complaints about not being able to have a space bar to reply to the puppys messages  the k cowbell and x drum licks are phenomenal in the music area and one full octave using the numbers is great much better than a baby keyboard that only has 5 tones the 4x3 touch sensor grid is very visible so the illusion of actually having a normal touch anywhere screen is lost battery life is phenomenal 3 years on the stock heavy dutys alkalines would probably corrode before actually discharging  off/low/high is great so simple for loudness and you can go from low to high or high to low without it resettingif you save the twisting locking tabs from the box you can affix it to a play pen wall the handle seems redundant it has handgrips on the back and using the handle can allow the screen frame to flop openthe screen frame auto flipping seems almost magical,4,2025-07-2,negative,1

497,B06XL1B7QN,toddler approved.My 2 year old toddler actually likes this toy. It has a lot of features and it can go from looking like a laptop to folding down flat like a tablet. He mostly likes mashing the keys and listening to the music. The screen is kinda outdated though and not visible from angles. You have to be right in front of the screen to see it. I think it's an informative toy and will benefit him once he's older and actually understands what to do. It's definitely a good toy to grow with your kid.,4,2024-12-17,negative,1

525,B06XL1B7QN,Fun but....This is a nice interactive toy but the screen is not very clear. Hard to see unless it's held at the perfect angle and even then it's not a clear resolution. The screen also swings a little too much unless it's folded pretty far back. It's meant to be used from a low angle only (like the floor) and not on a table.,4,2024-01-12,negative,4

546,B06XL1B7QN,"Works as expected.I almost didn't order due to many reviews suggesting that the screen itself is dysfunctional and won't stay in place but I took the chance anyway.

There’s a video attached with this review, on the lowest volume setting, and it sounds terrible - quality is poor. Not sure if defective or how the laptop is generally.

There are a lot of learning materials out there, and even better ones from Leap Frog. My 4yr old can get the same lessons from books themed to his favorite Cars movie, so he prefers to use that.

766,B09MW38Z5F,"Just use a different marker - trust me.My 3 year old loves this and we own about every laptop and tablet, sort of learning thing out there it seems.  This one is her favorite, she loves coloring and tracking the lines and says she's learning. She will sit and do this for a good 30-60 mins straight. Crazy I know, but she really likes it. Plus it's interactive it says the sounds of the letter you are tracing.Now if I could post a picture of her face that she decided to color when we weren't looking and she's never done this before, was completely blue and it was like half her face.  We washed, used dawn soap and it wasn't coming off.  We are like Oh well, lessoned learn and this pen is going in the trash.  Well, she took a bath a little later and it all came off, so that was a relief.  Just be warned, it's not easy to just wipe off or wash off in the sink, but it did ALL come off in the bath, so I guess it's washable?  I won't let her use this pen anymore because I don't want to go through that again, nor have to soak an outfit to get it to come out.Would I buy again or give as a gift - YES.",4,2022-08-9,negative,5
767,B09MW38Z5F,Great for preschoolers.This leap frog prep for preschool activity book comes with six different pages that are interactive. Some of the pages you write on with a dry erase marker and some of it you touch with your fingers. There are three modes-one is explore mode one is learn mode and the other is play mode.  You can use all those modes on each of the six pages. I really like that there are two different volume buttons so one is a little softer than the other. The dry erase marker that comes with this activity book is not my favorite. Once you write on the book it is very hard to get it off even right away. I wish they could have included a dry erase marker that you could erase right away or didn’t take a lot of water to rub off the ink. I tried two different other dry erase markers (from two different brands) on this book and I was able to wipe it off right away.

870,B01FVS6V9Y,"Extremely Disappointed! Inferior Quality, Short Warranty.I purchased the VTech Touch and Learn Activity Desk Deluxe from Amazon in September 2025, and I regret it. Initially, the product worked fine, but after the batteries ran out and I replaced them with new ones, the unit completely stopped working. Despite multiple attempts using fresh, high-quality batteries, the product remains non-functional.What frustrates me even more is VTech’s response. I contacted customer support, only to find out that their warranty lasts for just 90 days from the purchase date. To put that in perspective, other toy manufacturers offer 1-year warranties, which clearly shows that VTech doesn't stand behind the long-term durability of their products. This is a glaring issue that speaks volumes about the quality—or lack thereof—of their products.It’s unacceptable that a product, which is marketed as a durable and fun educational tool for children, can stop working so soon after the warranty expires. VTech is clearly not committed to customer satisfaction or product longevity, and this short warranty period only confirms my concerns about the overall reliability of their products.I highly do not recommend this product to anyone, especially if you're looking for a long-lasting, reliable toy.

The valve seems one way and we can’t figure out how to uninstall.We called the 1-800 number and were shocked to hear that there was nothing we you could do and no way to help us with our issue. No form of relief in instructions, nor was a replacement part was offered.  I was told to go to the retailer and perhaps they’d be more helpful. This is a brand new desk that my daughters were excited to play with but will apparently never be able to use.When I looked back at the instructions again to see if I was just distracted by children while installing, the instructions are incredibly vague and give no warning to this potential installation issue.This is incredibly disappointing customer service.

Just had the main desk part fall off onto my foot, instantly bruising while moving it. The stool comes apart immediately so my tiny 2 year old lifts it to move it and the legs fall off. It’s super loud and annoying with little educational benefit. It’s just one of those noisy garbage space wasters that the Montessori method admonish. Probably gonna just sell it at my next garage sale. It’s useless. Waste of money. Id return it but bought it for black Friday and gave it to my daughter in January. Past the return window.

The sounds are annoying, the phone thing doesn’t seem to work and the biggest problem is…the buttons are too sensitive so…if she happens to rest her arm or hand on the table she is inadvertently holding down a button or several buttons while she is trying to press other buttons…so it will just say the same incorrect word/words over and over and over again…”head, head, head he-he-he-head, this is my head head ar-arm arm head.” I mean, what on earth is a child going to learn from that? I get it that most electronic kids toys have a similar issues…but this one for me was worse bc the toy has almost zero redeeming qualities. Also, the bottom of the legs of the desk and stool slip on the floor so it’s not safe. It’s was also tricky to assemble when it comes to the desk snapping into place…and now it won’t snap out of place so I can break it down and return it.

1007,B01FVS6V9Y,Too expensive for what it is.It dose not have a place for the extra cards so they are laying all over my living room. That is the main reason why I did not like this product.

I was wanting to get my son this product so bad and once I did it was just a disappointment. Great product if it would just actually stay on. I put new batteries in and it said the same thing.

1018,B01FVS6V9Y,Constantly changing batteries....I was excited to get this for our 3 year old at Christmas but am disappointed. Its a wonderful concept but should have been equipped with an outlet power source. The batteries do not last longer than a few hours of play time. We are constantly changing the batteries and it gives a repetitive and annoying message to change the batteries instead of letting the child play.,2,2020-06-22,negative,4
1019,B01FVS6V9Y,Not working.Not working with battery. Tried everting I could and it didn’t play. I didn’t return it because I don’t want to Waite my time to find a box to cover it.,2,2020-06-3,negative,9
1020,B01FVS6V9Y,"Fall Hazard.We bought this for my 2 year old grand daughter and the seat is small, even for her tiny bottom, and hard for her to sit on. She has fallen off of it several times. The hard plastic legs don't work well on a hard floor. They slide too easily so it is best to set it on carpet or a rug. The activity cards work well enough but, if she pushes too hard on a picture, as toddlers will do sometimes, the table will slide away from her. Again, hard floors don't work well with the slick plastic. The table and chair are just not very sturdy. Not a good purchase in my opinion.",2,2020-05-23,negative,4
1021,B01FVS6V9Y,Doesn't work.I purchased this for Christmas for my 2 year old and half the sheets did not work. I kept getting error messages. Waste of money and not worth returning.,2,2020-05-21,negative,9
1022,B01FVS6V9Y,"Does not do much.I usually love Vtech products but this is lame.  It does not do much more than any other toy that tells you what letter you push, and it's really slow, and counterintuitive in such a manner as to actually teach anything.

It's an ok toy for the price, but I probably would have gone with an actual desk. Storage between the lid and the shelf is small. Also, the little buckets can only fit a few crayons or pencils, and they get caught by the lid when you open and close it, breaking the crayons in half. The kids had fun drawing on the activity cards with their markers, so I can't return the product, but I will not recommend to buy, and I will not buy again.",2,2019-12-31,negative,4
1030,B01FVS6V9Y,Cheap plastic..The body and the chair are made out of very cheap plastic. The legs all fall out. The chair is uncomfortable and too small for my two year old.,2,2019-12-10,negative,4

My main reason for getting it was the art easel and the other brand I intended to buy was not recommended for a 2-year-old, so I decided to buy one that was.  When it arrived my husband and I played with the educational circuit board section for an hour.  We loved it, but when we gave it to our grandson, at 2, he doesn't understand you can't rest your palms on 4 letters at a time or bang on 6 instruments.

1045,B01FVS6V9Y,"Was great toy while it lasted (~5 months).I bought this as a birthday present for my son who turned 2 in Feb. He loved it and was eager to use it to learn. Sometime around the middle of the year, he stopped playing with it because it became glitchy. After a change of batteries, it was still glitchy. It seems the switch that toggles between music and activity mode isn't making proper contact and it rapid cycles between the two modes, announcing it every time it changes--very annoying, as you can imagine. The warranty was only for 3 months so no help from the manufacturer. Nearly 50 bucks spent for an item that now does not perform the primary function for which it was purchased. Glad I didn't buy any additional activity cards or cartridges for it.",2,2018-09-29,negative,10

1050,B01FVS6V9Y,"Cool idea, but....I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and it's a neat toy. However, the legs that connect to the stool just slide in. They do not click in like the legs on the desk, so of course the legs get pulled off a lot. The music player has a slot for a cartridge, which I didn't know about or read about until looking through the Q and A's. The only way to get the cartridge is to buy the expansions.

It's cool if you always forget to turn off things or your not watching your kids because as soon as they walk away, it constantly repeats its self. Great educational toy and a slight step up from the older one. It's bigger too. Cards are not interchangeable. (I knew this beforehand and it works for me because the kids can't fight over the cards). The side holders are in shapes instead of an open trough. Which is a bummer because things get stuck in the shapes and they are hard to clean too. Lastly, the darn legs keep falling off the stool. Will have to glue them on.",2,2016-09-17,negative,4

For two, it doesn't shut off automatically. Therefore, you have to continuously get up and turn it off when the baby turns it on, but turns around and walks off because he/she changed their mind and wants to play with something else. Another thing is, where it looks like a play phone is supposed to go, there is a hole there.

There is zero tactical feedback letting them know they are unintentionally touching different buttons on the table and do not seem to care the audio response is constantly repeating that no, that was not the correct letter of the alphabet that was requested.

1104,B01FVS6V9Y,Loved but not durable.Our 4 and 2 year old love this table. It has not lost its shine over the four months we have had it.

1107,B01FVS6V9Y,"Better for children over 3 years..I was really excited to give this to my toddler, but even though he seems to be enjoying it, I’m frustrated by how finicky it is.For example, when he’s playing the search game for the alphabet and he has to find the letter S, if he doesn’t press exactly in the middle of the letter box, it either doesn’t do anything, or it thinks he’s pressing the letter beside or beneath S. I don’t like that he’s choosing the right letter and being told he got it wrong, it doesn’t seem like that’s going to help him learn.And I wish the phone part came away from the backboard like the letter writing part does. Because when he’s trying to play “phone a friend”, if he accidentally puts his hand on the board and touches a letter when he’s reaching over to touch the numbers on the keypad, it ends the “phone a friend” game and he has to start all over again.He’s only 2 yrs 9 months, so hopefully as he gets older he’ll be better able to avoid accidentally touching letters while using the phone toy, and he’ll be able to more precisely press the letters on the board so that they actually work.",3,2020-09-11,negative,1

1120,B01FVS6V9Y,Disappointed.The product description said when you flip the desk over you have a chalkboard surface...when I received mine it was only a plastic surface.

I wish it were not this easy for him to remove the legs or remove the top part of the desk (the part that does all of the talking). He played with it for a good 5 mins and it doesn't seem to hold his attention any longer than that (unless he's sneaking and taking it apart).,3,2019-12-27,negative,4

1128,B01FVS6V9Y,"Good BUT Also REALLY Bad!.I bought this for my daughter about 3 years ago along with Learn to Read expansion pack so if have it on hand when she was at the age and ready to start learning to read. She is 4 years old now and still plays with this table and the little chair is something she uses on a daily basis to either sit a the tabel with or mainly she uses it as a step stool to reach the sink to wash her hands or the counter to help me cook (use your own Judy as a parent as to whether your child can use this to stand on). While the table has always worked and my daughter still plays with it to this day and learned from it, there is a HUGE disappointment to it. The extra Expansion Pack I bought with it back when I first purchased the table about 3 years ago, it DOES NOT WORK!! 😡😡😡 I didn't think to check to see if it worked with and was comparable with the table back when I first bought it because IT SAYS IT WAS! So now I have a useless pack that my daughter should now be able to use and wants to so bad, but she can't because it's absolutely useless and not compatible with the table like it should be. Wish I could get my money back but it's obviously been way to long.",3,2019-12-22,negative,4

1134,B01FVS6V9Y,Buttons are WAY too sensitive.I hoped to get this for my daughter so we could make it fun for her to learn. The features and functionality is great and she enjoys it but for all the wrong reasons.Don't get me wrong. I think this is a great little educational toy. But there is one issue I'm having with it that just turned it into a desk (for now). The issue is that it is very sensitive. Extremely slight pressure (think how sensitive a touch screen is) will set off any of the buttons.As a result it just sounds like an auctioneer with a child's voice in my living room just going off. She enjoys laughing at the crazy sounds that come out of it as a result but not in anyway educating her. We've just turned it off for the time being and will try again when she's a little more dexterous.,3,2019-06-11,negative,4
1135,B01FVS6V9Y,"Slipping/falling hazard for little mats included.Although I love this item I will give it three stars because my daughter slipped twice already on one of the little mats. It’s such a great toy and it tells you when the battery is low. It would be great if it didn’t come with the little mats that go on the table because when my daughter dropped one on the floor she stepped on it and slipped on it. Luckily I was able to catch her once, she almost did the splits :( the other time I wasn’t near enough to catch her and she fell pretty bad. For the manufacturer making this, you should try not to add these as they are someone if a slipping hazard even to an adult if they step on it and slip.",3,2019-06-7,negative,0
1136,B01FVS6V9Y,Didn’t hold toddler attention.I got this on a warehouse deal and I had high hopes but my toddler tired of the electronic features super quick. Maybe older kids would like it more?

Also, I with it didn’t say “bye bye” when it turns off, because then I want to turn it off to save on the battery because he hadn’t been paying attention to it, when he hears the “bye bye”, he immediately goes and turns it back on again out of spite, just to not pay attention to it again after 5 min (or less)",3,2019-02-24,negative,4

In my opinion, the table should have been designed to have a selection to actually press, than to touch.

She dropped it on Sunday & cracked the screen. It turns on but the touch screen does not work. It has a two year manufacturer’s warranty. I called Amazon & since the 30 day warranty was up (she has had it 2 months) they could not help me but gave me LeapFrog’s 800 number. I called them and a cracked screen voids the manufacturer’s warranty. 😳 They even put me on hold and checked with a Supervisor.  Seriously? Amazon told me it was covered. 🤷‍♀️ This product is recommended for 3-8 year olds; they are going to drop it. If the screen cracks that easily they need to make the product better.My recommendation is not to purchase this product because it is not make well enough to withstand a drop from a 3 year old.

However, not even 30 minutes of usage, she was throwing tantrums due to the screen lag. At that point, she didn't bother to use it for the remainder of the trip. For this reason, I ended up returning it.During the setup, I decided to try the “90-day trial” for more apps as there isn't much offered without the additional subscription. Unfortunately, it was late at night and I mistakenly made an error while entering my email. After returning from my trip the subscription was supposedly cancelled, and the tablet was restored to the factory and returned. To my surprise, months later I’m still getting charged!?I reached out to Leapfrog customer service and no one could help due to the wrong email! I have provided the order #, phone number, the tablet’s serial #, card number that was being charged and still “they can't find any account with that information”. After multiple attempts at solving the issue with Leapfrog, I decided to go through my bank to dispute the charges. They kept $30 for the first charge, at this point I have up. At least I got back my other 4 charges of $30.Everything was fine until now. Apparently, I’m being charged again because I “resubscribed”.

He played with it for a couple of months and then it started turning off by itself, the screen would glitch and it would turn off. Finally it stopped turning on at all. I contacted Leapfrog and they said I need to replace it. They will not do anything to help because I apparently didn't buy it from an authorized seller. I bought it from Amazon directly from the leapfrog store. Watch out because they will send it to you from Amazon but the ""seller"" will never be Leapfrog.

1450,B07PLG93NS,Glitchy and not worth the price!.These products glitched so much that all they did is frustrate my children!

I couldn't get a shipping label in time to get my money refunded back so I'm here to warn you .... DONT BUY IT! Get a regular tablet and just down load cocomelon, baby shark, and other learning apps for your kids with it because this isnt it! And dont get me started on the ridiculous subscription .... I'm paying for something my baby cant even use. When I finally got the tablet to come on I had to purchase more items for her to add on to play. Why? if I have a subscription it should cover it?

Once the screen cracks or breaks. No kind of warranty offered by Amazon nor the manufacturer itself can honor it. You’ll be out of $100! I purchased this tablet back in March and my son dropped it a week later and the screen broke. They couldn’t do anything.

As all their products it can take punishment w/o breaking.  It includes some basic activities but a lot of activities requires additional payment for a fee.  Toddler should be at least 3 yrs old.

She's only younger and so she doesn't get to play in discriminately, but it should be more robust than this for this price. I love the idea of the tablet that it's leapfrog learning products that you can download apps for them I like that much better for her than the Fire tablet but ultimately I would say spend the extra money and go for the fire tablet.

Do yourself a favor though, you're really only going for the learning academy, which is just a browser based portal, meaning you can literally load it on any device, I've even had it running on a fire stick with Bluetooth m+k.

We plugged it in last night after it died, it was charging, woke up this morning and it won't budge. Just got it as a replacement for the first one yesterday. Same thing happened to the last one, but after a couple weeks. I also noticed things changed from the first tablet to the second we got, stylus is different, different charger. Which shows me they're fixing ""issues"" already. Too bad they didn't fix the battery. Contacted Leapfrog originally and they told me to just return it and get a replacement where I bought it.

I can live with that, but not when it takes so long to load and crashes every other game.

1516,B07PLG93NS,"Shockingly  Disappointing.I've been an advocate for LeapFrog products for well over a decade to friends and family. My last child now a toddler was not going to be an exception and we looked forward to giving her the latest version of what LeapFrog had to offer ,the LeapPad Academy Tablet. We got her this for Christmas and I was reallly excited to see what she would be able to make of it as my first two kids , now teens really benefitted from using this in their formative years. Truth be told they had Leapster Explorers and one lasted up till the arrival of the LeapPad.So where is the disappointment you may ask. Well from day one we noticed that the screen proved a bit unreactive at times but we simply put it down to software challenges that work out over time. But naively we were wrong , the problem grew progressively worse to the point where the frustration made my daughter abandon the device. The simplest of strokes wouldn't elicit a response on the screen . Also frustrating has been the WiFi connectivity , its been very inconsistent and drops linkage to the LeapPad academy midgame on a regular basis. In short this turned out to be a nightmare scenario for a bitSome respite came when we switched to run the Leappad Academy from the computer and laptops for her to play the games. She is now rebuilding some desire to play the games as she progresses in a consistent manner using the mouse. She really enjoys the LeapPad Academy and this (initially 3 month free) paid platform  has proven to be  the saving grace. It hasn't assuaged my personal frustration as the whole point of creting an avenue for learning has been disrupted significantly .

1519,B07PLG93NS,"I would pass.I am not impressed with this tablet for multiple reasons. Time based use... this is pointless if you have more than one kid, my 2.5 year old daughter knows to just select her brothers profile when she runs out of time and vice versa. The rubber padding comes off way too easy and is essentially useless. The screen itself is terrible because unless you are directly in front of it, you can't see the screen. The problem with this is if you want to help your kid or see what they are up to, you can't both get a good view... which leads to the other problem if you have more than one kid, they fight over it because they want to watch each other play, but since they can't both see, they end up pulling at it.  Finally with all of those issues, the value is poor due to how expensive the apps are. I am a fan of other leap frog products, but I would stick to a general tablet and free source/better value apps.",2,2020-01-28,negative,1

However, the ""free"" apps were a total joke, not age appropriate for my 2 year old, and not fun. Without a subscription there is literally no option to download more free apps. Everything was for sale $5-25 each, and a subscription is way more than I'd be willing to pay year after year as mu toddler grows up.

1591,B07PLG93NS,"Kids-ready tablet, but expensive & outdated.I was very excited about this LeapFrog LeapPad tablet for our son to play with. And he does enjoy playing with it. However, for $160 I would only recommend this to someone with no technology inclination whatsoever who wants a ready to go technology toy.Here's why: LeapPad is very easy to set up, comes preloaded with a handful of games and is generally ""kid proof"" right out of the box.Unfortunately, that's where positives end. The 7"" screen is of such poor quality that you have to be looking at it perfectly straight on to avoid distortion. Oh and it's worse in portrait mode than landscape and also worse at higher brightness. The device also runs on top of a very old ""neutered"" version of Android 4.4. It came out ~6 years ago and Google stopped releasing updates for it (including key *security* updates) almost 5 years ago. Given that this device relies on WiFi connectivity and will likely travel with the child to various WiFi networks (e.g. restaurants, hotels, airports, etc) this device has decent potential to get infected with something nasty and then spread it to other systems. I work in IT Security and a device running Android 4.4 would never be allowed on a corporate network these days.LeapPad does have a web browser and a couple of other regular tablet features in ""parent"" mode. They are pretty mediocre by today's standards. It also does include a handful of games and they're quite fun but it's pretty clear from using the device that it's really not going to entertain kids for very long and they're really trying to get you to sign up for LeapPad academy ($9.99/mth or a bit less for a yearly subscription).Now, say you accept this cost as the games are quite good. In that case, LeapFrog academy supports a multitude of devices, including Amazon Fire tablets. You can get a new Amazon Fire 7 tablet with a much better screen, dimensions and running a much newer version of Android (7.1 I believe) for $69.99. That $100 you're saving can buy you a super sturdy case for it and almost cover a year of LeapPad academy! And no offense to LeapFrog, but I have a lot of faith in Amazon's application & device security practices. It's going to be much better at being a tablet than LeapPad in every way but is still not running a full version of Android. You can get that full version of Android in a Samsung Galaxy Tab E lite or in a clearance model of a Samsung Galaxy tablet, likely running Android 8 or newer for around $140 - still cheaper than LeapPad. Want to spend even less? Take a look at some well rated ""no name"" tablets - they can be quite decent.You would then have to set up parental controls on either Amazon Fire or another tablet to make it kid-safe. This is relatively easy to do by following online tutorials but I recognize that this still may be an issue for folks and thus would be the main situation where LeapPad comes out on top.As for me, even though we have this LeapPad already, I don't want it on my Wi-Fi network. I've put it on my guest network for now but we'll likely go down the Amazon Fire 7 route in the future. And I'm thinking that LeapFrog Academy subscription will be worth the money in a few months to get our son to interact with (and learn from) some very well-made educational games!",3,2019-08-31,negative,1

I was gracious for amazon replacing it so I got the warranty for the second one, which I recommend because I had to exchange it again because it just suddenly would  not hold a charge. Also it will freeze semi frequently, kids always panic lol. So far a restart fixes it.Positives is that the kids really love the games they are expensive, and almost no games are included with set up. The cheapest games are 10$ and go to 25$ and they offer bundles of like 4 games for 20-30$ but never the good games are included. They have sales on major holidays so that helps save money.The device and its games really are fun and educational. They make learning easy and fun, it's a great way to distract you kids and know the content is safe.I dislike that leap pad pushes the heck out of there popular games with ads so kids are never content and always wanting more more more...I also dislike that the main learning game ''Academy'' is a yearly subscription on 40.$$$ which I bought for my 3 and 4 year old and they almost never used. Now it's expired they are 4 and 5 now and love it. I DO like that you can use the academy game on your cell phone as well as the device and it syncs your progress.I really dislike that it requires sooooo much money to get a good group of games. The description of the games on the web page are terrible and there are no refunds if you download a game you don't like.I wanted to give 3 stars because the device is cheap, I got over 200$ invested in just games and then it stops working... exhausting and disappointing.I gave it 4 stars because the kids really love it and DO get a lot out of it.

1636,B07PLG93NS,"Be smart about where you buy this from *updated*.Got a couple of these from this Amazon site, and felt relieved to know that there was a one year warranty that comes with it. Well, one of the tablets died; just went black and wouldn't charge or turn on again. I thought, ""No problem, I'll just call LeapFrog, let them know what happened and get shipped a replacement."" After a few emails back and forth, LeapFrog informed me that having bought the tablets from Amazon, they are void of the warranty. In other words, I should have bought it from Toys R Us or Walmart. My daughter really liked it, so it looks like I'll make a trip to Walmart. But I will MAKE SURE that the warranty is valid.Updated: I got a call from the toy manufacturer telling me that this particular 3rd party (Quality Products) has a connection to the Leapfrog company. Thus, there is a valid one year warranty and we received a new one just this week :)",4,2023-03-16,negative,10
1638,B07PLG93NS,"On a budget tablet?.(LOOKING TO BUY??? READ UNTIL THE END)When I had first purchased the leapfrog academy within the first few days it just stopped working, it wouldn’t charge or turn on. After a few days of it being plugged in it just turned on and it’s been on ever sinceIf you’re looking for a tablet that your kids won’t break then this is for you. It’s been dropped off counters, dressers and down the stairs 🤦🏻‍♀️ and it’s still kicking.I should note that this tablet CANNOT download mainstream apps (YouTube, Nextflix, Disney Plus) but with going through the Amazon AppStore we were able to find apps that would let you access them.The battery lasts (at 100%) anywhere from 2hrs-4hrs or more if lucky with constant use. I also noticed it’s a little slow at times depending on what you’re doing, not all the time but with bigger webpages.It’s not bad for the price, but if you’re looking for a tablet with more of a “AppStore” and more mainstream functions then I suggest buying an iPad.Leapfrog games are super educational and even tho it’s not a highend tablet my sons still able to have fun and watch YouTube videos (which was the initial reason for buying)The case comes off for easy cleaning which has a sturdy stand, the speakers are loud & it also has a 3.5mm Jack for headphones.Overall it’s not bad, but it’s not great. It functions normally so if you aren’t picky and need your kids to stop taking your phone and are on a budget this is for you.",4,2022-01-10,negative,10

1641,B07PLG93NS,"Nice learning tablet but needs improvements.It's a really nice learning tablet for kids. I set up my 3 younger kids with each their own profile so you have to make sure it's on the right profile for the appropriate child because I think the learning activities are age based.The pen/stylus is not so great in my opinion and when we got it the material mesh covering it already had a tiny hole, after using it for a few days just the normal rubbing was making the hole bigger and within a week the whole material part was gone, not long after that the rubber tip broke off.  Not impressed.  Emailed the company but never got a reply.The screen might be shatter proof but sure gets scratches easily.

It is disappointing to have such a new device scratched when my kid has only sat and played on it twice.he has only ever used the stylus pen and his finger on the screen.",4,2021-01-9,negative,1
1651,B07PLG93NS,"Good learning tablet to start at early age.My 5 year old was using iPad for various learning games and videos, but he recently broke iPad. This time I did not want to give him expensive thing like iPad and LeapFrog leapPad perfectly fits the bill.It is not that expensive and made very sturdy. Tablet is covered in rubber guard case and feels well designed and sturdy. It comes with nice stylus and kick stand to keep tablet on desk. We were impressed as soon as we opened the box we were impressed with high quality hardware. However as soon as we turned the tablet ON, we were little disappointed. Screen is not as high quality as iPad and viewing angle is very poor. You need to be perfectly viewing straight. The display seems mediocre which is expected at this price point. I am not sure if LeapFrog made it in this way to protect kids eyes. My son did not mind it and did not notice much difference.With excitement, my son started exploring included games and application and in fe days, he got bored with it. Most applications are below his age and does not interest him very long. He wanted his iPad back because it was loaded with lots of learning and fun applications. You can download and buy new applications from Leapfrog store, but they seemed quite expensive. To keep interest going, I signed up for 3 months free trial for LeapFrog Academy and honestly it his hard to keep his interest going on with it. There are few reasons behind it: (1) For kids who cannot read yet, it’s not intuitive to scan through all the contents and try it out. So he needs parent support. (2) Content is not very polished yet. For example, reading the book. when you ask to read to kids, it is way too fast. (3) His familiarity with iPad and Apple Ecosystem may be pushing him back because he is not familiar with Android system.I will keep involved with him to get his interest going and see how it goes. It should be mentioned that LeaFrog Academy costs $7.99/month and can be used on any device.Overall, I thing this is great started tablet and still think that if I had a choice earlier I would have started with this rather than iPad since it is meant for kids and slowly transition him to expensive options such as iPad when he grows up.Overall, I think it is good learning tablet to start at early age.",4,2019-09-29,negative,1
1652,B07PLG93NS,"Good tablet, requires subscription.Like most things these days, unfortunately this tablet requires a monthly subscription in only to access LeapFrog Academy. LeapFrog Academy is an online-only service that is a digital world where your child can create an only avatar and complete different levels, working themselves through a map of different lessons.For the most part, this tablet would prefer to have internet access at all times. Luckily enough, you can save up to 24 lessons by favouriting them for offline use. This tablet does have an integrated Parental Control mode that allows you to limit access to applications, or set availability of the device.Because this is used by kids, this tablet is very rugged. The screen is plastic and there is a rubber case that will protect the tablet when it is inevitably dropped. It is very hard to crack a plastic screen, just be wary that it will scratch.Overall, this is quite good value considering the integrated applications. It is disappointing to see that there is a subscription for the Academy, however I understand that it costs money to run their servers.",4,2019-09-11,negative,7
1654,B07PLG93NS,"Perfect For Preschoolers, Pricey App Store.For its price point, this is a pretty good tablet. It comes with all you need to get started, including protective bumpers and a stylus. I call them bumpers because it is definitely not a case. I haven’t tried throwing it down the stairs but I don’t think that I can trust this silicone case for rough play. The tablet slides out of the case quite easily. There is a stand on the back of the case. The stylus is attached by a short cord and slides into the side of the tablet for storage. The usb port, micro SD slot, headphone jack, power and volume buttons are all located on the top of the tablet and not covered by the case. I don’t think it’s a great idea to make the micro SD slot that easily accessible to kids, I would have hidden it in a different place.The tablet works right out of the box. It is preloaded with some apps and others can be added. I’m pretty tech savvy and I still had to play around with this tablet to really understand how to get it going. I had to sign into my leapfrog account (or sign up for one if you don’t have one) and then set the limitations for the children using the tablet. You can set up a profile for multiple children and monitor pretty much everything from screen time to what they’re looking at.My children have specific apps that they love. Netflix, youtubekids, and roblox are the most important ones. Roblox can be downloaded through the amazon app store, but netflix has to be done differently. I still cannot get youtube kids on the tablet. The amazon app store is accessible through the parent portal of the tablet. The instructions that come with the leappad are very vague and I found myself online looking for videos on how to access and download different apps. Keep in mind though, that the leapfrog approved babysitting service isn’t available for the netflix app if you should download it. Your child will have access to everything.I think the leapfrog app store is expensive, more so than others. You get a three month subscription to the leapfrog academy included with the purchase of this tablet and after that it costs eight dollars a month. It’s basically a subscription to ongoing age appropriate school lessons. If you choose not to continue with your subscription, you can still access other apps on the tablet. So no, it doesn’t render the tablet useless.The home screen is pretty interactive, and it is really easy to navigate. There is also a voice that explains things as you go. There is a camera on the front and back of the unit, pictures are good quality. The screen is okay, it’s said to be shatter resistant. You have to look at it straight on, or you can’t see what’s on it very well. It makes sharing difficult.The recommended age for this tablet is three to eight. I think its definitely more suitable for preschool and not for older kids. My older kids were over it very quickly and didn’t have much interest in the baby apps it came with (their words, not mine). The leapfrog approved content is good, but very basic so more geared towards younger. My younger kids were happy with exploring this and find it easy to play, they used the stylus a lot.Overall, I think this is a good tablet if you have a younger child and are on a budget. My children have been using ipads from the get-go and I can set a lot of the same restrictions on those with more options as far as apps go. I find the leappad extremely limited. Which is good or bad depending on who you’re purchasing it for.",4,2019-08-31,negative,7

1732,B07PLG93NS,"4.5 stars.I like this tablet for my almost 3 year old. He had a Kindle tablet that a friend got him (against my wishes lol) and I really dislike that tablet. He gets really crazy when I take the Kindle away and somehow he gets on YouTube and finds Cartoon Network Adult Swim or other weird videos. With the Leappad, he can't do that. There are some videos from some of the apps I downloaded, but most are educational. I would take away a star because the apps are kind of expensive and Leappad Academy isn't cheap either. I'm not saying it's too expensive and that it's not worth it, it is worth it, but the apps should be more affordable for people who buy the tablet. Especially individual apps. I was honestly pretty surprised at how much I had to spend for just a handful of apps. Despite this, my loathing towards the Kindle tablet prevents me from taking a star away lol. Also, I've noticed that my son isn't crazy attached to the Leappad like he is with the Kindle. I let him play with the Leappad when he wants throughout the day, and he doesn't sit on it all day. He also doesn't freak out if I take it from him to do something else. He totally melts down if I take the Kindle from him. To me, that's another big plus in favor of the Leappad. He doesn't seem obsessed or addicted to it.",5,2024-01-26,negative,7

1809,B06XL1B7QN,"Impossible to see, completely useless although nice concept.The screen is completely unviewable, first the screen is very reflective which makes it catch light and have high glare, second the contrast of the screen (black LCD over blue-lit background) is so poor that you cannot see anything anyways beyond some vague shapes, third the viewing angle is non-existent - if you move 1 degree up/left/down/right it also completely removes visibility.  Beyond this, the actual concept is nice with 2-in-1 laptop/tablet, children email writing, and songs, but there's not much here that you wouldn't find in almost any other children's toy (maybe like 30-40 permutations of songs/activities/etc) but since you can't see anything anyways, it's much more frustrating for the child than fun and you'll get alot of anger/crying with it.

What I notice was the hook where you would lift up the laptop up. I believe that pops off and that’s the problem, I could be wrong all I know it’s very annoying problem.

1898,B06XL1B7QN,PARENTS BE AWARE OF MUSIC MODE.I have to write this review on my laptop however I am warning all parents of the music mode touch screen. As parents know children soak things up as a sponge soaks up water. They have big imaginations and tend to emulate what they see. I am big on a child remaining as a child and not being a raunchy adult. There is a clip in which I as a parent and most parents who actually care to raise their children properly would disagree with as being child friendly. In music mode as you are touching the music keys scout will dance and one of those dances involves shaking of the rump which is very inappropriate for a 2 year old a 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 etc. Thats not what a child should be engaged in and its a huge violation in my opinion. Yes its a great tool to help them learn but be vigilant because if not monitored could easily introduce vulgar and inapropriate movements in your child. Not surprising considering Netflix and cuties and now people trying to force children to make adult decisions at school..... Ima leave it there...,2,2022-11-7,negative,1

At 4 years old I'm not ready to buy her a laptop or even a chromebook yet. I though this would be a great way to allow her to play pretend while also learning with an interactive toy. The problem is, she had absolutely no interest in it. To be fair, she uses a Kindle Fire and has an old iPhone, which are obviously more advanced than this product. However, I thought the laptop style of it would at least pique and keep some of her interest. She literally played with it for five minutes and told me she didn't want it. Her 5 year old sister has a chromebook so she has no interest in it either. May be good for kids who are not used to modern devices but if your child is accustomed to any type of modern tablet/phone/etc. it is doubtful this product will hold their interest at all.

To be fair to the product, I must reveal most of my dissatisfaction is from comparing it to the old version of this toy. I bought the old version used, it came programmed with a name already, no big deal, had the usb to change to my little girls name, or so I thought. I plugged it into my computer and the software for this product, conveniently had been discountined. I was a little frustrated with that fact, but I saw they had made a new version and I was more than happy to spend any amount of money on it. My little girl loved the old version of this toy and I LOVED the personalization, it said your child’s name so many times, it even had emails that you could have personalized with your child’s name and 3 family members! It also had a song of your child’s name. Similar to the violet plush toy, but even more personalized. Now comes this piece of crap, you program your child’s name into it alright, once, you program it into the first letter of their name, when they press it it’ll say “that’s the first letter of your name” and spells it. It literally only spells it, it doesn’t even SAY it. Shame on you leapfrog, as a parent with a child with autism, who is constantly looking for ways to teach her to say her name, the old software/toy was going to be perfect. This “personalization” on this new toy is cheap and lazy and ridiclous.",2,2018-11-18,negative,10

2005,B06XL1B7QN,"Toy ok, packaging was dangerous.There was a literal piece of wood in my packaging. It was jagged. Box was barely taped shut as if it was returned and sold immediately.

2007,B06XL1B7QN,"Lots of options.For the money, there are lots of options. The touch screen works, but the images are hard to see and interpret for little babies. One game makes them select a hair brush? How many babies can interpret this blurry image as a hair brush?The other negative is I wish I had hit all the letter buttons before the return window ended. My I, J and K buttons all say I. Oops.But again, for $18 to distract a baby on a long road trip, it’ll do. I’ll just have to make sure he doesn’t have the game when he really needs to know his letters the RIGHT way.",3,2022-10-7,negative,1
2009,B06XL1B7QN,good beginner.This is fun for a 2-3 year old however the screen is a bit dark so it's kind of hard to see Scout the dog. They need to brighten up the graphics. If you are outside or in bright light they wont be able to see the screen.,3,2022-09-16,negative,1
2010,B06XL1B7QN,Ehhh.It’s okay for a toddler but honestly the quality of the screen could be ten times better. I am slightly disappointed with this purchase.,3,2022-08-19,negative,1
2011,B06XL1B7QN,"For ok life kids who can know their letters.Not many games.  Just push a letter and the laptop says the letter back and screen shows an animal jumping around.  I did feel that much fun would come from this for a younger child who died not even recognize a letter or number.  Would not be able to create a text when not able to identify letters.  Once a child is able to do this i feel it would provide minimal fun.  I was hoping for more interactive games to teach.  Exp:  game shows a letter and encouraged the child to find it, push button, then see the animal jump and hear sounds.  Good level of voice on machine.  Just not interactive or teaching",3,2022-08-17,negative,4
2012,B06XL1B7QN,"Good design, poor quality.The design of this one is great, my kid loves it. However, the screen quality is very poor and one spot is not functioning well after a few weeks. That just kills half of the fun since he can’t play the number game now.",3,2022-08-6,negative,1
2013,B06XL1B7QN,"Good, but.We like the leapfrog tablet but it appears that there are some slight improvements that could/should be made. the numbers are good until it gets to 10, which is listed as 01.the screen also doesn’t stay in one place in laptop mode, it’d be better if we could get it to not rotate at the slightest change.",3,2022-07-17,negative,10

2016,B06XL1B7QN,"So much potential hurt by usability.There are so many great things about this toy, but a few key drawbacks make it almost unusable.1. Contrast is terrible. It’s so difficult to see the images on the screen through the touch sensors. Worse, there’s no obvious use case for the touchscreen which doesn’t even seem to work. So it’s a stupid design since the kid can barely see what’s happening. The LCD lets too much of the blue light through the pixels… like watching a dark movie on a bad LCD TV.2. Volume only has two settings.",3,2022-07-3,negative,1
2018,B06XL1B7QN,Ehhh….Nothing spectacular about this product. You can barely see the screen. Graphics are ancient. I’m a 90’s kid and nothing has changed since then.

2023,B06XL1B7QN,"No space bar?.My daughter got this for her birthday last year and her and her 3 year old sister love playing with it. I didn't notice it til today, but there's no space bar. How do you expect kids to type actual words? They don't care, I just thought it was odd. That and the letters aren't lined up like a keyboard so ya know. Volume has two settings and no headphone jack. Patience required.",3,2022-01-3,negative,1

2036,B06XL1B7QN,"Though I bought new....The retail box was beaten up and the Leap Top was taped onto the box, batteries were already installed - and the parent manual was missing.

2044,B06XL1B7QN,"Better for a 1 or 2 year old. Not older.I expected way more content from this thing. Considering my 3 year old is already using an actual tablet, it's doubtful that this will entertaining to her for very long",3,2018-12-12,negative,1

2046,B06XL1B7QN,It was cute and I liked the learning games.Worked well for awhile. It was bought for a Christmas gift and then all of the sudden stopped working the other day. The batteries were changed and nothing worked other than once when the toddler dropped it on the floor in tablet mode on the rug and it began to light up. Once shut off again nothing worked. It didn’t work again after that with new batteries in it. It was cute and I liked the learning games. We bought the tablet vtech instead.,3,2018-04-13,negative,10

Even when he wasn’t playing with it he would repeat the things he learned from it throughout the day. Unfortunately, it just stopped working without warning less than a month after purchasing it (wasn’t the batteries). Because he loved it so much, he was that much more devastated when it wouldn’t work. It was a amazing toy while it lasted but I’m not sure if I would replace it. Don’t really want to go through that again and by the looks of other reviews; this doesn’t seem like a rare occurrence.",3,2018-01-25,negative,4

2057,B06XL1B7QN,Wish it was louder.Only complaint is the volume is very low. Has two settings for volume and on the second (highest) cannot hear it much over a light conversation or any background noise.,4,2025-10-15,negative,6
2062,B06XL1B7QN,"Not bad..My 3yo thinks it's neat but gets bored of it quickly. It's easy for her to carry, cute, and durable. She's smacked it on a few things. 🤣",4,2025-08-19,negative,4
2064,B06XL1B7QN,great design quickly outgrown.it works fine teaching abc and 123 it would have been better to do a qwerty keyboard 10/9/7 style goint 10/9/9 having the extra buttons for space and enter instead of having the space bar be enter i guess you can tell your kid has outgrown it when you start getting complaints about not being able to have a space bar to reply to the puppys messages  the k cowbell and x drum licks are phenomenal in the music area and one full octave using the numbers is great much better than a baby keyboard that only has 5 tones the 4x3 touch sensor grid is very visible so the illusion of actually having a normal touch anywhere screen is lost battery life is phenomenal 3 years on the stock heavy dutys alkalines would probably corrode before actually discharging  off/low/high is great so simple for loudness and you can go from low to high or high to low without it resettingif you save the twisting locking tabs from the box you can affix it to a play pen wall the handle seems redundant it has handgrips on the back and using the handle can allow the screen frame to flop openthe screen frame auto flipping seems almost magical,4,2025-07-2,negative,1

2077,B06XL1B7QN,toddler approved.My 2 year old toddler actually likes this toy. It has a lot of features and it can go from looking like a laptop to folding down flat like a tablet. He mostly likes mashing the keys and listening to the music. The screen is kinda outdated though and not visible from angles. You have to be right in front of the screen to see it. I think it's an informative toy and will benefit him once he's older and actually understands what to do. It's definitely a good toy to grow with your kid.,4,2024-12-17,negative,1

2105,B06XL1B7QN,Fun but....This is a nice interactive toy but the screen is not very clear. Hard to see unless it's held at the perfect angle and even then it's not a clear resolution. The screen also swings a little too much unless it's folded pretty far back. It's meant to be used from a low angle only (like the floor) and not on a table.,4,2024-01-12,negative,4

2126,B06XL1B7QN,"Works as expected.I almost didn't order due to many reviews suggesting that the screen itself is dysfunctional and won't stay in place but I took the chance anyway. I have since found that you have to angle the screen a little more than 90° in order for it to stay put. Maybe it could've been designed a little better but knowing this, I have no issue with the product.",4,2022-12-8,negative,2
2128,B06XL1B7QN,"Came defective and all scratched up..The media could not be loaded.I was really looking forward to something that my kiddo will love, and learn from. However, I’m not sure if she’ll be as interested as I though- due to the sounds / volume seeming defective. There’s a video attached with this review, on the lowest volume setting, and it sounds terrible - quality is poor. Not sure if defective or how the laptop is generally. Not sure what the touch screen aspect is, it doesn’t seem to have anything that you need it for. My device also came all scratched up, as you can also see in the photos.",4,2022-12-1,negative,1
2129,B06XL1B7QN,It's age appropriate but limits what they can do.I was a bit disappointed they only have 2 songs and it's not a touchscreen it's more like a push on the screen type. I wanted it to help her pronounced her name when  it's spelt and I think she would be playing spelling words in the game function but otherwise not a bad buy my 2 year use it but gets bored afterawhile.
